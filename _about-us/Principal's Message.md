<h3><strong>Principal's Message for 2026</strong></h3>
<p><strong>115th Anniversary</strong>
</p>
<p>For more than a century, generations of Zhonghuarians have walked through
our gates, carrying with them hopes and aspirations to learn well and grow
well. At the Zhonghua Alumni Association Annual General Meeting on 14 December
2025, I had the privilege of interacting with senior Zhonghuarians who
are in their 80s and 90s. They spoke fondly of their school memories which
include friends, teachers, and principals. These were the very people who
shaped their teenage years. They graduated from Zhonghua Secondary School
with friendships, values, and a sense of purpose that endured long after
their school days. This reminds us that while times have changed, our commitment
to education in terms of shaping character and minds remains steadfast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2026 marks a significant milestone in our school’s illustrious journey
as we commemorate our 115th anniversary with the theme, <strong>“Remember, Return, Reignite” (源・聚・燃)</strong>:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“Remember” (源)</strong> calls upon us to honour the legacy of those
who came before us, whether they are Zhonghuarians who have graduated,
or educators and leaders who shaped the school with vision and dedication.
It reflects the spirit of “饮水思源”, reminding us to give thanks to the source
of our growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“Return” (聚)</strong> encourages us to come home to reconnect with
the place where our stories began. A place that has nurtured dreams and
character, and to revisit the values, people, and memories that shaped
us into who we are today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“Reignite” (燃)</strong> inspires us to carry the flame forward,
to renew our passion, strengthen our commitment, and boldly shape the future
with courage and purpose. Together, let us remember our past, return to
our roots, and reignite the spirit that defines us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Strategic Approach to Developing Scholars and Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>We remain committed to strengthening what matters most and these are:
teaching and learning, student well-being, and a caring and enabling school
environment. In 2026, we will sharpen our strategic approach through the
4L framework: <strong>Life-long Learning, Life-wide Learning, Life-wise Learning, and Life-strong Learning</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this framework, we aim to develop the dispositions, mindset, and
agency for continuous growth; to cultivate curiosity and the ability to
apply learning across diverse contexts; to nurture values, sound judgement,
and a sense of purpose to lead and contribute meaningfully to society;
and to build inner strength and resilience to thrive through challenges.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Note of Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>The saying “<em>It takes a village to raise a child</em>” needs no introduction.
None of this would be possible without the collective efforts of many.
I am deeply thankful to parents who have taken the time to write in to
commend our staff (teachers, allied educators, and administrative staff)
for the difference they have made in their child’s life. Such words of
encouragement affirm the quiet but noble work that our team does each day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our sincere gratitude also goes to our stakeholders for their unwavering
support, especially the School Advisory Committee, alumni, parents, and
community partners, as we work together to nurture Zhonghuarians to become
Scholars and Leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 2026 be a year of learning and growth for all of us! Wishing all good
health, joy and fulfilment.</p>
