<h3><strong>Principal's Message for 2025</strong></h3>
<p>I am deeply honored to be entrusted with the stewardship of leading our
school in its mission to nurture Zhonghuarians into passionate learners,
dynamic leaders, and connected citizens. I would like to express my heartfelt
gratitude to my predecessors for laying a solid foundation by fostering
a strong culture of care, collaboration, and learning. It is truly a privilege
to continue building upon this legacy with my dedicated team of teachers
and colleagues.</p>
<p>
<br>Since joining the school in October 2022, I have had the privilege of
engaging with parents, the Parent Support Group, the Alumni Association,
and the School Advisory Committee. I sincerely thank them for their unwavering
support for our students and their commitment to a strong partnership.
I look forward to more collaborative opportunities as we work together
to provide Zhonghuarians with a rich and fulfilling schooling experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school was founded in 1911 by a group of Chinese community leaders
who were inspired by Dr. Sun Yat Senâ€™s vision to provide education for
girls at a time when it was widely considered unnecessary due to prevailing
societal beliefs. Today, we remain guided by this same vision, striving
to provide opportunities for Zhonghuarians to explore, engage, and empower
themselves as they embark on their journey of self-discovery and learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The period from 2023 to 2024 was one where we reviewed our processes and
examined our efforts in our journey to develop our students. Other than
reviewing our signature programmes, we also had a team of senior MOE personnel
who validated our processes and provided many insights for us to further
sharpen our focus. In 2025, we will continue to engage staff, students
and stakeholders to consolidate our plans to better prepare Zhonghuarians
for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.zhonghuasec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/zhonghua-signature-programmes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Future-ready Framework</a> shows
our commitment to prepare our students to be ready for life, for work,
and for learning. These platforms and the day-to-day learning inside and
outside of the classrooms are designed to equip students with emerging
21st Century Competencies (E21CC) to thrive in an ever-changing global
landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2025 bring us closer together as a community, united in our shared
goal of nurturing the best for our students.</p>
