### **Principal's Message**
##### **Principal's Message for 2022**

<img src="/images/principal.jpg" style="width:25%;margin-right:15px;" align = "right">Last year, Zhonghua Secondary School commemorated our 110th anniversary, a milestone only made possible because of the perseverance and hard work of our past and present School Leaders and staff, School Advisory Committee members, alumni, parents and students. The theme for our anniversary, “A Century of Affinity, A Connection to Zhonghua”, \[缘起百年， 情系中华 \], attests to the strong ties that each generation of Zhonghuarians has to the school, in no small part due to the strong culture of care among our staff and students. As we celebrated more than a century of heritage and excellence in the midst of an on-going pandemic, what we have achieved affirms our purpose, and serves as a reminder to the Zhonghua family that we will be able to overcome any challenge so long as we move forward as one.

It is with gratitude and hope that we welcome 2022: gratitude for all that we have and have achieved; and hope that we will build on our successes and continue to nurture many more generations of Zhonghuarians who contribute meaningfully to the community and society.   

In our 111th year and beyond, we remain steadfast in our commitment to provide our students with a rich and well-rounded education that develops their interests in academic and broader areas of endeavour, regardless of their backgrounds, needs and strengths. With the nation and world battling COVID-19, the years ahead may be challenging, but they will also bring new possibilities and opportunities. The rich learning for staff and students over these two years, in particular, has given us insights in envisioning the future of education – one where students are empowered to take ownership of their learning, and where the affordances of technology are harnessed to enrich teaching and learning. Drawing on these insights, we have started to review and re-design our programmes and learning experiences for our students so that they are able to develop critical competencies that will serve them well in school, and as they learn for life.    

The greater the expectation of our students to adapt to a rapidly evolving world, the greater the urgency to inculcate in them a strong character and values that will enable them to make good decisions for themselves and for others. This is why we emphasise character education in all that we do. Through our curricular and co-curricular programmes and day-to-day experiences, we inculcate in our students the school values of Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence. It is our hope that Zhonghuarians will also live out the school motto [礼义廉耻] – Courteous in Conduct, Righteous in Principle; Edified in Character; Dignified in Reflection, both during their time with the school and when they move on to greater roles and challenges in life.   

With our committed staff members and supportive stakeholders, especially the School Advisory Committee, the alumni and the parents, we will continue to make great strides towards realising our vision of nurturing Scholars and Leaders who are able to navigate the future confidently.   

Wishing all a healthy and happy 2022!

去年，中华中学庆祝创校110周年。这重要的里程碑是历代学校领导、学校咨询委员会、教职员、校友、家长和学生坚持与努力的成果。校庆的主题是“缘起百年，情系中华”，它充分体现了每一代中华人与学校的紧密联系。在冠病疫情仍然存在之时欢庆110周年，一方面为了肯定中华百年来取得的卓越成就，另一方面也想提醒每个中华成员，只要我们携手共进，就能克服任何挑战。    
  
我们是怀着感恩与希望来迎接2022年的：感恩我们目前所拥有的一切，并希望我们能在已建立的基础上，继续培育更多能为社会做出贡献的中华学子。    
  
迈入第111年以至未来的每一年，我们会继续坚守岗位，为来自不同背景、有不同需要与不同能力的学生提供优质、全面的教育，培养他们学术与其他领域的兴趣与能力。在我国与全世界为冠病疫情奋战的大背景下，来年虽然会充满挑战与变数，但也为我们带来了无限的契机与可能。过去两年，我们的教职员和学生都收获了丰富的学习经验，这些经验为我们在重新规划未来的教育面貌时提供了新的视角与借鉴——着力于培养学生自主学习的能力，以及在教与学中运用科技辅助。我们已着手检讨和调整课程内容与各项学习活动，让学生能掌握在学校及终生学习时所需的关键能力。    
  
要让学生更好地适应瞬息万变的世界，他们必须具备良好的价值观，唯有如此他们才能在人生中为自己、为他人做出正确的决定。因此，我们非常重视学生的品格教育。通过各项学校活动和各种学习体验，我们向学生灌输了“坚韧、正直、关爱、卓越”的价值观。我们也希望每个中华的学生能在求学时代以至未来的人生中，能恪守“礼、义、廉、耻”的校训。    
  
在教职员和学校伙伴，尤其是学校谘询委员会、校友会和家长会的鼎立支持下，我们一定会继续为实现学校愿景而努力，培养有信心引领未来的学者和领袖！    
  
祝愿大家在2022 身体健康, 幸福快乐!
