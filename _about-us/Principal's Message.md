<h3><strong>Principal's Message for 2026</strong></h3>
<p><strong>115th Anniversary</strong>
</p>
<p>For more than a century, generations of Zhonghuarians have walked through
our gates, carrying with them hopes and aspirations to learn well and grow
well. At the Zhonghua Alumni Association Annual General Meeting on 14 December
2025, I had the privilege of interacting with senior Zhonghuarians who
are in their 80s and 90s. They spoke fondly of their school memories which
include friends, teachers, and principals. These were the very people who
shaped their teenage years. They graduated from Zhonghua Secondary School
with friendships, values, and a sense of purpose that endured long after
their school days. This reminds us that while times have changed, our commitment
to education in terms of shaping character and minds remains steadfast.</p>
<p>2026 marks a significant milestone in our school’s illustrious journey
as we commemorate our 115th anniversary with the theme, <strong>“Remember, Return, Reignite” (源・聚・燃)</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>“Remember” (源)</strong> calls upon us to honour the legacy of those
who came before us, whether they are Zhonghuarians who have graduated,
or educators and leaders who shaped the school with vision and dedication.
It reflects the spirit of “饮水思源”, reminding us to give thanks to the source
of our growth.</p>
<p><strong>“Return” (聚)</strong> encourages us to come home to reconnect with
the place where our stories began. A place that has nurtured dreams and
character, and to revisit the values, people, and memories that shaped
us into who we are today.</p>
<p><strong>“Reignite” (燃)</strong> inspires us to carry the flame forward,
to renew our passion, strengthen our commitment, and boldly shape the future
with courage and purpose. Together, let us remember our past, return to
our roots, and reignite the spirit that defines us.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Approach to Developing Scholars and Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>We remain committed to strengthening what matters most and these are:
teaching and learning, student well-being, and a caring and enabling school
environment. In 2026, we will sharpen our strategic approach through the
4L framework: <strong>Life-long Learning, Life-wide Learning, Life-wise Learning, and Life-strong Learning</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this framework, we aim to develop the dispositions, mindset, and
agency for continuous growth; to cultivate curiosity and the ability to
apply learning across diverse contexts; to nurture values, sound judgement,
and a sense of purpose to lead and contribute meaningfully to society;
and to build inner strength and resilience to thrive through challenges.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Note of Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>The saying “<em>It takes a village to raise a child</em>” needs no introduction.
None of this would be possible without the collective efforts of many.
I am deeply thankful to parents who have taken the time to write in to
commend our staff (teachers, allied educators, and administrative staff)
for the difference they have made in their child’s life. Such words of
encouragement affirm the quiet but noble work that our team does each day.</p>
<p>Our sincere gratitude also goes to our stakeholders for their unwavering
support, especially the School Advisory Committee, alumni, parents, and
community partners, as we work together to nurture Zhonghuarians to become
Scholars and Leaders.</p>
<p>May 2026 be a year of learning and growth for all of us! Wishing all good
health, joy and fulfilment.</p>

<p><strong>2026年校长献词</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>115周年校庆</strong>
<br>一个多世纪以来，一代代中华学子怀揣着积极进取、学有所成的希望与憧憬，走进我们的校园。2025年12月14日，在中华校友会年度大会上，我有幸与几位年届八九十岁的老校友交流。他们满怀深情地回忆在校的点点滴滴——同窗的情谊、老师的教诲、校长的关怀以及共同度过的美好时光，这些都塑造了他们的青春年华。他们从中华中学毕业时，不仅收获了知识和友谊，更树立了正确的价值观，培养了崇高的使命感，这些宝贵的财富，在他们离校后一直长久地伴随着他们。这提醒我们，时代虽在变迁，但我们在塑造品格与心智，坚守教育使命上的承诺，将始终坚定不移。</p>
<p>2026年是我们学校辉煌历程中的一个重要里程碑。我们将以<strong>“源·聚·燃”</strong>为主题，庆祝中华中学建校115周年：</p>
<p><strong>“源”（Remember）- 饮水思源，铭记母校培育之恩</strong>
</p>
<p>回到教育的源头，感恩学校给予我们知识的甘泉与人生的根基。不忘初心，铭记那些启蒙我们、塑造我们的珍贵岁月。</p>
<p><strong>“聚”（Return）- 重聚校园，重新连结彼此情谊</strong>
</p>
<p>校友们从四面八方归来，重新聚首在这片熟悉的土地上。不仅是人与人的相聚，更是心与心的重新连结，让校园再次充满温暖与活力。</p>
<p><strong>“燃”（Reignite）- 重燃激情，点亮使命与自豪</strong>
</p>
<p>重新点燃对学习的热忱、对理想的追求，以及身为校友的骄傲。让那份初入校园时的青春激情再次燃起，照亮未来的道路，续写人生新篇章。</p>
<p><strong>培养学者与领袖</strong>
<br>我们将继续强化我们的教与学，照顾学生福祉以及营造一个充满关爱的校园环境。2026年，我们将通过全新的“4L”学习框架完善我们的策略方针。</p>
<p>通过这个框架，我们旨在培养学生持续成长的的品格、心态和主动性；激发好奇心及在不同情境中应用所学的能力；培育价值观、明辨是非的判断力和清晰的使命感；建立内在力量和韧性，让学生在面对挑战时战胜困难。</p>
<p><strong>致谢</strong>
</p>
<p>育人绝非靠一己之力，这个道理不言而喻。没有大家的共同努力，这一切都不可能实现。我深深感谢那些拨冗来信的家长，表扬我校教职员工（教师、协作教育者及行政人员）在他们孩子成长中所付出的努力和产生的积极影响。信中那些鼓励的话语，无疑是对教职员工日复一日默默付出的高度肯定。</p>
<p>我们也衷心感谢各方伙伴，特别是学校咨询委员会、校友、全体家长及社区伙伴们坚定不移的支持。让我们继续携手努力，培育中华学子成为兼具学识与领导能力的栋梁之才。</p>
<p>愿2026年成为我们所有人共同学习与成长的一年！祝大家身体健康，喜乐充盈，收获满满。</p>
<p>校长</p>
