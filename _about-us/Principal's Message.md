<h3><strong>Principal's Message for 2025</strong></h3>
<p>I am deeply honored to be entrusted with the stewardship of leading our
school in its mission to nurture Zhonghuarians into passionate learners,
dynamic leaders, and connected citizens. I would like to express my heartfelt
gratitude to my predecessors for laying a solid foundation by fostering
a strong culture of care, collaboration, and learning. It is truly a privilege
to continue building upon this legacy with my dedicated team of teachers
and colleagues.</p>
<p>Since joining the school in October 2022, I have had the privilege of
engaging with parents, the Parent Support Group, the Alumni Association,
and the School Advisory Committee. I sincerely thank them for their unwavering
support for our students and their commitment to a strong partnership.
I look forward to more collaborative opportunities as we work together
to provide Zhonghuarians with a rich and fulfilling schooling experience.</p>
<p>Our school was founded in 1911 by a group of Chinese community leaders
who were inspired by Dr. Sun Yat Sen’s vision to provide education for
girls at a time when it was widely considered unnecessary due to prevailing
societal beliefs. Today, we remain guided by this same vision, striving
to provide opportunities for Zhonghuarians to explore, engage, and empower
themselves as they embark on their journey of self-discovery and learning.</p>
<p>The period from 2023 to 2024 was one where we reviewed our processes and
examined our efforts in our journey to develop our students. Other than
reviewing our signature programmes, we also had a team of senior MOE personnel
who validated our processes. They affirmed our customised curriculum to
meet our diverse students’ needs, the strong culture of care for both our
students and staff, and provided sound insights for us to further sharpen
our focus. In 2025, we will continue to engage staff, students and stakeholders
to consolidate our plans to better prepare Zhonghuarians for the future.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.zhonghuasec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/zhonghua-signature-programmes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Future-ready Framework</a> shows
our commitment to prepare our students to be ready for life, for work,
and for learning. These platforms and the day-to-day learning inside and
outside of the classrooms are designed to equip students with emerging
21st Century Competencies (E21CC) to thrive in an ever-changing global
landscape.</p>
<p>May 2025 bring us closer together as a community, united in our shared
goal of nurturing the best for our students.</p>

<br>我深感荣幸能够肩负起领导学校的重任，与大家一起实现我们的使命——培养中华学子成为热爱学习、充满活力的领导者以及与社会紧密联系的公民。我衷心感谢历任校长，他们为学校打下了坚实的基础，营造了关怀、合作与学习的良好文化。能与一支敬业的教师团队和同事们一起传承并发扬这一优良传统，我感到无比自豪和珍惜。</p>
<p>自2022年10月加入学校以来，我有机会与家长、家长会、校友会和学校咨询委员会进行交流。我由衷感谢他们对学生的支持，与学校建立了稳固的伙伴关系。我期待未来更多的合作机会，共同为学生创造丰富而有意义的校园生活。</p>
<p>中华中学创立于1911年，由一群受孙中山先生理念启发的华社领袖发起。当时，女子教育并不被重视，学校的成立为女性提供了受教育的机会，具有开创性的意义。今天，我们传承了这一精神，为学生提供探索知识、协作学习和自我成长的机会。</p>
<p>2023年至2024年，我们对学校的各项流程进行了全面检视，重新审视了我们的特色课程。此外，教育部也对我们的工作进行了评估，肯定了我们为满足学生多样化需求而制定的课程以及关爱学生和教职员的文化。他们提出的宝贵的建议，也帮助我们优化工作重点。</p>
<p>展望2025年，我们将继续与全体教职员、学生和学校伙伴携手合作，帮助学生更好地为未来做好准备。</p>
<p>为了帮助学生更好地面对未来的挑战，我们推出“面向未来框架”，通过精心设计的课程与活动，让学生掌握21世纪技能，能自信地应对瞬息万变的全球环境。</p>
<p>让我们携手同行，为每位学生的全面发展共同努力！</p>
