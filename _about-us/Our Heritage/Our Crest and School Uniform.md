#### **Our School Crest**

<img src="/images/crest%20and%20sch%20uniform%201.png" style="width:65%">

The school adopted a school crest in the shape of a Begonia leaf. The Begonia is a very hardy plant with red flowers and dark green leaves. Its ability to survive naturally in almost any kind of condition represents Chung Hwa’s adaptability and flexibility to changes, and hence, its ability to survive against all odds.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
The colour GREEN signifies freshness, youth, growth, life, vitality and resilience.  
The colour WHITE is the emblem of purity, virtue and brightness.

Students are encouraged at all times to emulate such enduring qualities as the Begonia; that is

*   To be steadfast and strong,
*   To be determined and decisive, and
*   To cultivate qualities such as excellence, endurance, faith, hope, promise and goodness.

Formerly, Chung Hwa female students wore white shirts with below-the-knee pleated skirts while male students wore a full white uniform, with the metal school badge pinned on at the left chest level.  

The uniform was redesigned in 2002 with major changes to the female uniform.  

Currently, Zhonghua female students wear white blouses with the school logo sewn at the left chest level, complemented by a green skirt. The full white uniform for male students was retained, featuring a white shirt with white bermudas for lower secondary levels and white long pants for the upper secondary levels.
