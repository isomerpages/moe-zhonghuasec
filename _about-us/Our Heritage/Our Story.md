#### **The Beginning**

| **Year** | Significant Event |
|:---:|---|
| **1911** | Chung Hwa Girls’ School was opened on 15 September 1911 through the concerted efforts of Mr Tay Peng Teng, Mr Puan Yeow Pang and members of the Chinese community.<br><br>The establishment of Chung Hwa Girls’ School was a timely development that took place during an era when the roles and contributions of women in society were being seen in a new light. In heeding Dr Sun Yat Sen’s call for the provision of education for girls in Singapore, these leaders of the Chinese community helped to mark a turning point for women in the Chinese community in Singapore.<br><br>Chung Hwa had started out with the modest aim of providing basic primary education for Chinese girls. However, as it evolved and grew in strength and stature, its role expanded to include teacher-training. Eventually, Chung Hwa embraced the mantle of secondary and pre-university education for all. |
| **1925** | The original location of Chung Hwa Girls’ School was at Mohamad Sultan Road. It had slightly over ten students at its inception but later to meet the need for larger premises, the school moved to Tank Road.<br><br>With the combined efforts of the school and the Board of Directors in fundraising and in its search for a bigger building, the primary school section was shifted to No. 57, Niven Road. With greater interest and support from the community, enrolment grew to more than a hundred in subsequent years. |
| **1930s <br> to<br> 1940s** | Chung Hwa Girls’ School started teacher training courses in the mid-1930s to create a local pool of teachers to meet growing needs. In 1935, Chung Hwa introduced a simplified Normal Training Course, and these cadets graduated in 1941. <br><br>In 1942, Classes were suspended with the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese Occupation of Singapore.<br><br>In 1947, Chung Hwa resumed classes with the reintroduction of two teacher training courses. Teacher cadets also graduated from the first post-war batch of the Normal Training Course.<br><br>Many of the graduates stayed on at Chung Hwa or returned to Chung Hwa to teach – a strong testimony of the loyalty and commitment that the school inspired in those who had tread the Chung Hwa path.  |
| **1950** | In 1950, teacher cadets from the second post-war batch undertaking the simplified Normal Training Course graduated.<br><br>The school attempted to sustain its teacher-training classes but these were eventually terminated between 1950 and 1951 when the government set up the Teachers' Training College.  |
| **1951** | Completed in 1951, the building at Bartley Road, known as the main school, housed the secondary school section named Chung Hwa Girls’ High School. The primary school, known as the sub-school, remained at Niven Road.  |
| **1954<br> to<br> 1958** | In 1954, the school became known as Chung Hwa Girls’ Middle School. In place of the training courses, middle school classes were introduced. In 1958, this system was replaced by the four-year secondary school system that remains at the core of secondary education today. In the drive towards nation-building during the post-war era, the quest for higher education was keenly felt. To meet this need, high school classes were introduced in 1954, which was later replaced by the two-year Pre-University system in 1962.  |
| **1957** | The school became a government-aided school.  |
