<p>Chung Hwa Girls’ School was opened on 15 September 1911 through the concerted
efforts of Mr Tay Peng Teng, Mr Puan Yeow Pang and members of the Chinese
community.
<br>
<br>The establishment of Chung Hwa Girls’ School was a timely development
that took place during an era when the roles and contributions of women
in society were being seen in a new light. In heeding Dr Sun Yat Sen’s
call for the provision of education for girls in Singapore, these leaders
of the Chinese community helped to mark a turning point for women in the
Chinese community in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Chung Hwa had started out with the modest aim of providing basic primary
education for Chinese girls. However, as it evolved and grew in strength
and stature, its role expanded to include teacher-training. Eventually,
Chung Hwa embraced the mantle of secondary and pre-university education
for all.</p>

<p>The original location of Chung Hwa Girls’ School was at Mohamad Sultan
Road. It had slightly over ten students at its inception but later to meet
the need for larger premises, the school moved to Tank Road.
<br>
<br>With the combined efforts of the school and the Board of Directors in
fundraising and in its search for a bigger building, the primary school
section was shifted to No. 57, Niven Road. With greater interest and support
from the community, enrolment grew to more than a hundred in subsequent
years.</p>

<p>Chung Hwa Girls’ School started teacher training courses in the mid-1930s
to create a local pool of teachers to meet growing needs. In 1935, Chung
Hwa introduced a simplified Normal Training Course, and these cadets graduated
in 1941.
<br>
<br>In 1942, classes were suspended with the outbreak of World War II and
the Japanese Occupation of Singapore.
<br>
<br>In 1947, Chung Hwa resumed classes with the reintroduction of two teacher
training courses. Teacher cadets also graduated from the first post-war
batch of the Normal Training Course.
<br>
<br>Many of the graduates stayed on at Chung Hwa or returned to Chung Hwa
to teach – a strong testimony of the loyalty and commitment that the school
inspired in those who had tread the Chung Hwa path.</p>

place of the training courses, middle school classes were introduced. In
1958, this system was replaced by the four-year secondary school system
that remains at the core of secondary education today. In the drive towards
nation-building during the post-war era, the quest for higher education
was keenly felt. To meet this need, high school classes were introduced
in 1954, which was later replaced by the two-year Pre-University system
in 1962.</p>
