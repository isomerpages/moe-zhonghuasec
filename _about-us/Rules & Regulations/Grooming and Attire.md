### **Grooming and Attire**
#### **School Uniform**
##### **Grooming and attire philosophy**
We believe that Zhonghuarians are proud of their school and are willing to wear their school uniform with pride.

Hence the school grooming and attire policy is one that is aimed at educating Zhonghuarians to look smart, decent and presentable at all times.  

Having proper attire and grooming is an outward expression of the students being ready to learn. Students who fail to meet the grooming and attire standard of the school will be required to rectify the problem before they are allowed to join in the lesson.

The Discipline Committee will conduct attire check every morning during flag raising as being properly attired is also a way for students to show respect to the state and school.

**Checking of hair and personal grooming**<br>
Spot checks on students’ grooming (hairstyles, nails, uniform etc.) will be conducted every morning and at other appropriate times.

##### **General Guidelines**
*   Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the school uniform is not allowed.
*   Students must be in full uniform at all times in class/school except during PE lessons or CCA.
*   Only approved CCA attire can be worn during CCAs.
*   All tops, except school blouse should be tucked in.
*   Students are to come to school and return home in either the full uniform or half uniform.

#### **Grooming**

Proper grooming of the students is important to the school as it signifies the pride that students have for themselves. The grooming policies aim to inculcate in our students grooming standards that promote good hygiene as well as to project a proper image of a student to the general public.

**Hair Colour**<br>
Students are not allowed to dye their hair. Students’ hair should be of natural colour.
