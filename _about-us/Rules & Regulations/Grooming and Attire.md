### **Grooming and Attire**
#### **School Uniform**
##### **Grooming and attire philosophy**
We believe that Zhonghuarians are proud of their school and are willing to wear their school uniform with pride.

Hence the school grooming and attire policy is one that is aimed at educating Zhonghuarians to look smart, decent and presentable at all times.  

Having proper attire and grooming is an outward expression of the students being ready to learn. Students who fail to meet the grooming and attire standard of the school will be required to rectify the problem before they are allowed to join in the lesson.

The Discipline Committee will conduct attire check every morning during flag raising as being properly attired is also a way for students to show respect to the state and school.

**Checking of hair and personal grooming**<br>
Spot checks on studentsâ€™ grooming (hairstyles, nails, uniform etc.) will be conducted every morning and at other appropriate times.

##### **General Guidelines**
*   Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the school uniform is not allowed.
