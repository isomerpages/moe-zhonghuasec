#### **Usage of Mobile Phones**
The school understands the importance of the mobile phone in this current time and thus allows students to bring their mobile phones to school. We are however more concerned with the responsible use of the mobile phones and thus restrict the time and location where the mobile phone could be used. Mobile phone usage is not allowed in the classroom block as it would cause distraction and disruption to the smooth flow of the lessons.
