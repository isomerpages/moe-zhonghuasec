<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>At Zhonghua Secondary School, the Music Department is committed to deepening
students' skills and appreciation for music; and cultivating a lifelong
love for music, empowering students to express themselves creatively and
confidently.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The music department embraces the belief that all children are musical
and seeks to develop their aural and expressive abilities and to empower
them to appreciate and participate in music. This is in alignment with
the Singapore Curriculum Philosophy, that every child wants to and can
learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Lower Secondary Music curriculum is offered to Secondary 1 and
2 students, and it seeks to develop musical understanding through the three
Musical Processes of Listening, Creating and Performing</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Secondary 1, students understand and learn about basic elements
and concepts of rhythm and harmony through music creation, appreciation
and performance. The curriculum culminates in the formation of a collaborative
vocal-instrumental band in Secondary 2, where students create original
arrangements and covers of popular songs and put-up live performances,
showcasing their musicality and collaboration. In addition to developing
their skills in instrument playing, students explore the world of sound
design by creating Foley sound effects using music production software.
Through these comprehensive music programmes, the department aims to inspire
a deep appreciation for music and develop studentsâ€™ skills in listening,
creating, and performing.</p>
<p>To further enhance their musicality and build confidence, students are
given opportunities to showcase their talents during Open Mic performances.
These events spread the joy of music-making throughout the school, allowing
students to share their passion and artistry with their peers.</p>
