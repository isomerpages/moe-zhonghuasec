### **Visual Art**
#### **Vision**
Nurturing Zhonghuarians to be 
- passionate artists in pursuit of artistic excellence;
- dynamic and resilient leaders in the artistic arena with a passion for innovation in fine arts, design, and digital media; and
- cultured and caring citizens with a global outlook, developing relevant artistic, design and media skills, and capacities for the 21st-century economy.

#### **Key Programmes**
**Visual Art Curriculum**<br>
The lower secondary Visual Art curriculum aims to develop visual literacy skills. At the end of the 2-year art studies, students acquire the basic skills in art-making as well as the knowledge to discern and understand the roles of art in our society. Students, who have an inclination towards art, are encouraged to continue the Art studies at upper secondary, when they gain a deeper understanding and further hone their art-making skills. The key objective of the Zhonghua Art programme is to develop in students their own voice, expressing visually their thoughts, ideas and feelings about their experiences and issues around them. The Upper Secondary Visual Art curriculum is offered to all streams.

**Art Elective Programme (AEP)**<br>
For more artistically inclined students, the 4-year Art Elective Programme (AEP) is designed to stretch students to have a deeper understanding of art from Sec 1. Through contextualised learning experiences, students learn to apply their art skills to real-world issues and situations. This is further underpinned by the theoretical knowledge of the development and roles of art in different contexts of culture and time. Annually there are camps, workshops and learning journeys for the AEP students.
