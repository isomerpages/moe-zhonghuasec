<p>The Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum in Zhonghua
aims to&nbsp;nurture Zhonghuarians of good character, who will contribute
actively to Singapore as responsible citizens.&nbsp;The CCE Committee oversees
the implementation of the CCE curriculum&nbsp;through lessons as well as
customised school-based CCE delivered through weekly assembly programmes,
student-initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) projects and other cohort-based
experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students acquire relevant knowledge, skills and
values through purposeful planning of CCE lessons adapted from MOE prescribed
modules.</p>
<p>The CCE Committee oversees the purposeful planning and implementation
of the CCE curriculum. Aside from weekly lessons which include discussions
on contemporary issues, there are various platforms for school-based CCE.
These include weekly assembly programmes, class-based Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects and other cohort experiences which complement lessons and
reinforce the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions in students.&nbsp;</p>
