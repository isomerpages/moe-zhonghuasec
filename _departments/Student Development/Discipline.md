<h4><strong>Discipline Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Discipline in Zhonghua Secondary School is one that is not punitive but
seeks to inculcate values and develop students holistically. The school
uses Restorative Practice (RP) as a key approach when managing discipline
related issues.
<br>
<br>Restorative Practice (RP) is an approach that aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>manage conflict and tension by repairing harm and strengthening relationship
as a way of building community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote building respectful and trusting relationship as a foundation
for teaching and learning; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide an opportunity for students to learn about the consequences of
their actions, develop empathy and work out a resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are guided through a series of reflective questions that enable
them to realise their wrongdoing and work out possible resolutions.</p>
<p>We aim to support the child and educate him/her of any wrongdoing. As
the saying goes, “it takes a village to raise a child”. Thus, we will involve
parents when necessary to support and educate the child as we recognise
that parents are our important stakeholders and play an important part
in bringing up the child. We will also re-direct every child’s focus from
“not doing it wrong” to “doing it right”.</p>
<p>We seek to ensure that the school is a safe and conducive environment
for both teachers and students so that teaching and learning can take place
in the classroom.</p>
<h4><strong>Expected Grooming and Attire Standards</strong></h4>
<p>1. All students’ hair should be of natural colour.
<br>2. Boys’ hair should not be funky or of inappropriate hairstyle such as
