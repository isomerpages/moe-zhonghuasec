### **Discipline**
#### **Discipline Framework**
The discipline framework in Zhonghua Secondary School is one that is not punitive but more of developing the child holistically.

We as disciplinarians aimed to support the child and educate him/her of any wrongdoing. As the saying goes “it takes a village to raise a child”. Thus, we will involve parents when necessary to support and educate the child as we recognize that parents are our important stakeholders and play an important part in upbringing the child. We will also re-direct every child’s focus from “not doing it wrong” to “doing it right”.

The Discipline Committee’s main objective is to ensure that the school is a safe and conducive environment for both teachers and students so that teaching and learning can take place in the classroom.
