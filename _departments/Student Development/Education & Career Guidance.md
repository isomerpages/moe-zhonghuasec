#### **Introduction**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to plan and manage their career pathways and learning throughout their lives. At secondary schools, the ECG curriculum focuses on exploration. ECG helps students understand themselves better and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways.

Students learn to:
* Be more aware of their skills, interests and abilities.
* Manage relationships with people who have influence over their decisions.
* Explore relevant courses of study.
* Understand careers in different sectors.

#### **ECG Counselling**

Zhonghua Sec has an ECG Counsellor to provide support to students (individually or in small groups). Students who would like to explore more in areas such as subject choices, course options or to find out more about their strengths and interests can have a chat with our school’s ECG Counsellor.

To make an appointment with Ms Tan Yi Ling (ECG Counsellor), please email her at&nbsp;[Tan_Yi_Ling_C@Schools.gov.sg](mailto:Tan_Yi_Ling_C@Schools.gov.sg).
