<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>In line with the school’s mission, the Humanities department strives to
do its part to nurture Zhonghuarians to be Passionate Learners, Dynamic
Leaders and Connected Citizens.</p>
<p>This is achieved by designing and enacting learning experiences that allow
students to strengthen their 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (21CC)
and embody the Desired Outcomes of Education such as Confident Persons,
Self-Directed Learners, Active Contributors and Concerned Citizens.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Progression</strong></h4>
<p>At Lower Secondary, students offering G3 and G2 levels will take both
Geography and History where the modes for assessment are both summative
and formative in nature. Meanwhile, students offering the G1 level will
take G1 Humanities which has replaced the previous NT Social Studies syllabus.
However, Social Studies remains the core subject and it is augmented by
Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs) in the areas of History, Geography and
Literature to provide students with curated learning experiences in those
subjects. Assessment-wise, G1 Humanities continues to be a non-examinable
subject where students are assessed through a Performance Task.</p>
<p>At Upper Secondary, all students will get the opportunity to offer Social
Studies at varying levels. Students offering Express and Normal Academic
courses will sit for the subject at the national examination together with
either Geography Elective or History Elective as the 2<sup>nd</sup> component
for Humanities. In addition, students offering the Express course will
also be given the opportunity to read an additional Humanities subject
like Full Geography and Full History.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to their Lower Secondary peers, the students offering Express
and Normal Academic courses will be assessed via summative and formative
modes at Secondary 3 while the Secondary 4/5 will only sit for summative
modes as preparation for the national examinations. For students offering
the Normal Technical course, Social Studies will be a non-examinable subject
and enacted in a modular manner in Semester 1 (Secondary 4) and Semester
2 (Secondary 3) respectively.</p>
<h4><br><strong>Key Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Within and beyond the classroom, students are exposed to varied learning
experiences that leverage experiential learning modes and technological
affordances and Active Learning strategies. In addition, the department
also curates suitable platforms for students to extend and apply their
learning in real-world contexts. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NUS Geography Challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International Humanities Symposium @ National Junior College</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bilingual Youth Model United Nations (BYMUN) @ Nanyang Girls’ High School&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ZHSS STEAMFEST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Carnival LJs to Fort Siloso &amp; Singapore Discovery Centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowgets Makerspace</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the department constantly strives to provide a well-rounded
and rigorous Humanities education for Zhonghuarians across all levels.
Beyond learning in school, the department takes great pride in preparing
our students to learn for life.</p>
