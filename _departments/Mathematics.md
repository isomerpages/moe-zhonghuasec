#### **Mission**
To provide students with an enriching Mathematics education so as to instil creative problem-solving skills.

#### **Key Programme**
The Zhonghua Mathematics Department strives to offer an enriching mathematics curriculum for all students to develop the necessary skills and mathematical literacy to learn, do and use mathematics. The recent mathematics curriculum places a greater emphasis on how mathematics is connected to the real-world, and in doing so, deepen their understanding and appreciation of mathematics.

The department teachers carry out meaningful learning experiences in the classrooms, including real world authentic tasks to develop mathematical modelling skills. In addition, the use of ICT tools such as Desmos, GeoGebra and Edmodo promotes deep learning in topics such as Geometry and Graphs and allow students to collaborate and discuss mathematical ideas.

Learning is customised to suit the different profile of learners in the school, with structured programmes being put in place to help different segment of students to improve on their mathematics.

In promoting Joy for Learning in Mathematics, mass enrichment programmes like the Sec 1 Mathematics and Science Trail at Changi Airport; Sec 2 Mathematics and Science Trail at Gardens by the Bay were carried out.

In addition, the department provides ample opportunities for students who show interest and strong ability in Mathematics to participate in different projects and competitions. These include The Singapore Mathematics Olympiads (SMO), Singapore Mathematics Project Festival and the Singapore and Asian Mathematics Olympiad (SASMO).
