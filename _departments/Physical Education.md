Students learn a variety of sports and games, acquiring basic skills of two major games per year in their four to five-year stint in Zhonghua Secondary School. Students learn basic skills in their Outdoor Education curriculum to be confident in the outdoor settings. They undergo progressive training for their NAPFA test during Physical Health Fitness lessons.

The opportunity to play games they have learnt in the past semester or past year allows continual honing of their acquired skills to achieve life-long learning of the games. Post exam activities are conducted to encourage students’ exposure to the outdoors.

They can loan sports equipment and play at designated PE venues.
