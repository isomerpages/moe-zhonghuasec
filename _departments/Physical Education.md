<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The Physical Education department seeks to develop physically competent
and confident individuals to pursue a lifetime of active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<h4><strong>Key programme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health Fitness</strong>
<br>Students learn a variety of sports and games, acquiring basic skills of
6 games modules in their four to five-year stint in Zhonghua Secondary
School. Students build their competencies in the Outdoor Education curriculum
(navigation, shelter building, outdoor cooking), risk management knowledge
to be confident in the outdoor settings. The students undergo progressive
training for their NAPFA test during Physical Health Fitness lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Interclass Games, Sports Carnival, Cross Country, and Cohort Activities</strong>
<br>Students apply their knowledge and skills learnt during PE lessons to
their experiences when they compete during interclass games and the Sports
Carnival. Students learn the values of teamwork, fair play and respect
for their teammates, opponents and umpires. The opportunity to play games
they have learnt allows continual honing of their acquired skills to gain
competence and confidence. The Cross-Country run builds and strengthens
students’ resilience when they persevere through the training and actual
run. It raises the physical engagement of our students. Cohort activities
are conducted to encourage students’ exposure to the outdoors and encourage
bonding opportunities within the class.</p>
<p><strong>Unstructured Play and Recreation Day </strong>
<br>Students are encouraged to adopt an active lifestyle by taking part in
Unstructured Play during recess and during Recreation Day on Tuesday afternoon.
They can loan sports equipment and play at designated PE venues or use
the school gym.</p>
