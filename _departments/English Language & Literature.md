<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The English Department of ZHSS believes that language enables us to think
creatively and critically, as well as express our views and persuade others.&nbsp;Language
makes it possible for us to function effectively in everyday life and allows
us to explore experiences, values and perspectives.&nbsp;The English Department
aims to develop innovative and critical thinkers who are independent, avid
readers with a global outlook, and an appreciation and love of the English
language. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Key programmes</strong></h4>
<h4><br><strong>Developing confident and effective communicators</strong></h4>
<p>Developing effective and confident communicators is a strong focus of
the department. Students are given opportunities to hone their oral presentation
skills through oral presentation practices, alternative oral assessment
at lower secondary, and class debates on gender, social, sports, environment,
ethical issues, particularly related to science, at upper secondary.&nbsp;Other
than raising critical awareness of language use and other methods of persuasion,
the learning of useful public speaking skills and techniques also help
students to express themselves with poise and confidence.</p>
<h4><strong>Assessment for Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Informal and alternative modes of assessment to encourage developmental
and formative assessments have been firmly established as our department
best practice. The department leverages on assessment for learning to further
develop effective communicators of the 21st century, focusing on identifying
studentsâ€™ specific strengths and weaknesses, with an emphasis on writing
and speaking in an authentic environment, with specific descriptive feedback
and suggestions for improvement given as well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Reading and Literature</strong></h4>
<p>Appreciation and love of the English Language and Literature within the
school is developed by inculcating in students a love of reading, broadening
their horizon, and helping them see more perspectives of the world. Exposed
to a range of texts in the form of expository essay, journalism, creative
non-fiction, poetry, fiction, and drama, students learn the various insights
that different critical approaches to these texts can yield. While strengthening
the intellectual power of every student, this knowledge of language and
literature provides each with an understanding of human nature as made
manifest through the written word. The department aims to turn students
into enlightened, literate, and thoughtful people who are able to articulate
their ideas effectively and confidently.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the future, the English Department aims to continue to develop the
linguistic and communicative competency of every Zhonghuarian, maximising
the potential of each, thus equipping them to thrive in a fast-changing
and highly-connected world.</p>
