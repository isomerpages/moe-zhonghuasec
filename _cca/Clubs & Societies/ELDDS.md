Zhonghua's ELDDS consists of the Drama Club, which forms the CCA arm, and the Debate Club, which is an interest group.

The Drama Club aims for students to discover the power of empathy through the art of drama. Drama Club members are bound by their love of the Arts, and are made up of vibrant individuals keen on expressing themselves on stage. In the Drama Club, students learn essential drama skills and vocal and physical expressions to convey emotions, as well as techniques of production. The Club aims to develop our members not just in performance but also in becoming well-rounded and confident individuals.

Debate Club members learn the art of persuasive argumentation, critical thinking, and effective communication. Through debating, members become better public speakers, improve their research skills, and increase their confidence in expressing their views. Debaters are taught how to engage in constructive dialogue with others who may hold different opinions.
