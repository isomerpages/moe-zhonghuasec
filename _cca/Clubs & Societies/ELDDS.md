Hero or Villain? Students get to decide in the Drama Club. Bound by our love of the Arts, we are a group of vibrant individuals keen on expressing ourselves on stage. In the Drama Club, we learn essential drama skills, vocal and physical expressions to convey emotions and techniques of production. 

In 2021, the Drama Club took part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, where we presented an original piece on an issue close to our hearts - mental health in youth. Exploring movement theatre, we devised and improvised our presentation piece, The Unbroken Glass. The journey to SYF began with much uncertainty but through hard work and passion, the club emerged strong and prepared to take on challenges. 2022 will be spent honing our craft, developing our skills and inculcating the love of drama in all of us. 

2022 also sees the full revival of the Debate Club. The debaters have actively participated in various competitions over two years, namely the Singapore Secondary Schools Debate Championships 2021 and 2022, the Australasian Interschool Debate Championship 2021, the Raffles Model United Nations Conference 2021 and the Debate Association Debating Championship 2022, among many others. Our debaters have made it to the final rounds of the debates, clinching individual speaker accolades for themselves.
