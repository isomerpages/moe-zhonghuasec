In the Library Society, Student Librarians perform the basic duties of book shelving, loaning and returning of books, and ensure that the library is pleasant and conducive for all. Our Student Librarians also promote reading activities through such initiatives as book reviews and a dedicated Bookstagram account. 

The Zhonghua Library contains the latest and most popular fiction titles, with regular acquisitions to cater to the teaching and learning needs of our staff and students, as well as their interests. 

The Library Society hopes to continue serving the school and grow lifelong readers amongst the school population.
