The InfoComm Club (ICC) aims to broaden and deepen members’ knowledge in Tech and Media through various learning programmes in such areas as Videography, Game Design and Programming, Makers and Artificial Intelligence. 

These programmes develop our members’ interest in the various areas and hone their 21st Century skills, dispositions and competencies. Students are given the opportunity to lead, both in national competitions and activities within the club.
