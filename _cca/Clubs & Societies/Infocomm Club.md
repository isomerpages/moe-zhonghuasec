<p>The role that technology plays in our lives is ever increasing. It is
therefore crucial for our youth to gain skills to harness and manage the
use of technology. The InfoComm Club (ICC) seeks to stretch and deepen
students’ knowledge in tech and media through various learning programmes
in such areas as Videography, Game Design and Programming, Makers and Artificial
Intelligence. With curated programmes and activities, members of ICC will
be able to ignite their passion and develop computational thinking and
other 21st Century Competencies. &nbsp;</p>

Along the way, learn to work effectively in teams, sharpen your mind and
express your inner creativity.</p>
