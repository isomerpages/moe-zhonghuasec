The Art Club is for students who are interested in art making and who seek exposure to various art mediums and opportunities to hone their art skills. Art Club members hone their repertoire of art skills by learning from professional artists and participating in workshops. Art forms covered include watercolour painting, oil painting, crochet, fused glass, photography and digital manipulation of images.

Our members’ works are often featured in various school publicity collateral and gifts. Art Club students serve as docents for our school’s art exhibitions and facilitate in-gallery learning experiences and conduct art tours for visitors.
