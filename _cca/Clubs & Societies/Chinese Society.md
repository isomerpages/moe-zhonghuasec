中文学会希望成为培养学生认识与热爱华族文化艺术的园地。学会成员在校期间主要学习华文戏剧表演技巧，并根据自己的兴趣学习书法及中国棋，同时也有机会参加跟传统文化艺术相关的课程，从而提升学生的综合素质以及文化素养。   

The Chinese Society is a vibrant CCA comprising of Drama, Calligraphy and Chess sub-groups. The Society hopes to develop students’ interest in Chinese culture and improve their skills in the Chinese Language.
