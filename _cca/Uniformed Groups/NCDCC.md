<p>Zhonghua Secondary School’s NCDCC is built on a culture of care, service
and excellence. We aim to develop our cadets into active citizens equipped
with life-saving skills. Our motto of <strong>“We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”</strong> encapsulates
the journey of NCDCC cadets in three phases:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We Learn –</strong> Cadets
will be equipped with the Triangle of Life skills, which include basic
firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED. Through a structured curriculum, cadets
will develop the skills and dispositions to step up as Community First
Responders to help themselves and others in times of need.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We Lead -</strong> Cadets
will cultivate soft skills such as communication (including methods of
instruction), relationship management and social awareness to develop themselves
into effective leaders. Cadets will also deepen their competencies to lead
as a cadet specialist either in Fire Safety, Medical Response, Urban Search
and Rescue, or Marine Fire and Rescue.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We Serve –</strong> Cadets
are empowered to serve the school and the wider community through public
duties and public education platforms such as the NCDCC Service Month.
Senior cadet specialists will also serve as mentors to groom the next batch
of lifesavers and leaders.</p>
