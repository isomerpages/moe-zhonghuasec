<p>Zhonghua Secondary School National Cadet Corps (NCC) has been recognised
for achieving the Distinction award for Unit Recognition excellence for
28 years consecutively. This is a testament to the dedication and hard
work of our cadets and teacher officers.</p>
<p>Our unit focuses on nurturing our cadets to become leaders with a resilient
mind, fit body and committed heart. Our programmes build our cadets’ confidence
and social skills. Activities such as airsoft rifle firing, dragonboat,
high-elements at Forest Adventure, orienteering games, camouflage hide-and-seek,
outfield cooking, and reconnaissance and surveillance keep our cadets active
and engaged.</p>
<p>On top of this, our cadets have been participating actively in fitness
events organised by HQ NCC, such as the Fitness Challenge and NCC Sports
and Games day. Through these activities, the cadets built a sense of camaraderie
and teamwork on top of pushing their fitness limits.</p>
