Zhonghua Secondary School National Cadet Corps (NCC) unit has achieved a Unit Recognition Award – Distinction for 26 consecutive years. This is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our cadets and teacher officers over the years.  

Far from focusing solely on regimentation, the Zhonghua NCC unit nurtures our cadets to become leaders with resilient minds, fit bodies and committed hearts. Our unit’s programmes build our cadets’ confidence and social skills.  Activities such as airsoft rifle firing, dragonboating, 1-star kayak certification, orienteering, camouflage hide-and-seek, outfield cooking, and reconnaissance and surveillance keep our cadets active and engaged.  

Our cadets participate actively in fitness events organised by HQ NCC, such as Fitness Challenge and NCC Sports and Games day. These activities also allow cadets forge a sense of camaraderie and teamwork.
