Zhonghua Secondary School National Cadet Corps (NCC) has been recognised for achieving the Distinction award for Unit Recognition excellence for 28 years consecutively. This is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our cadets and teacher officers.

Our unit focuses on nurturing our cadets to become leaders with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. Our programmes build our cadets’ confidence and social skills. Activities such as airsoft rifle firing, dragonboat, high-elements at Forest Adventure, orienteering games, camouflage hide-and-seek, outfield cooking, and reconnaissance and surveillance keep our cadets active and engaged.

On top of this, our cadets have been participating actively in fitness events organised by HQ NCC, such as the Fitness Challenge and NCC Sports and Games day. Through these activities, the cadets built a sense of camaraderie and teamwork on top of pushing their fitness limits.
