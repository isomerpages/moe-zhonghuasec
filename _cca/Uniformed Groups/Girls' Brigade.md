<p>The mission of The Girls’ Brigade Singapore is to develop each girl and
officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling
“Every Girl a Leader” and “Every Officer a Servant Leader”.</p>
<p>Members of GB are imbued with good moral values through involvement in
various service-learning activities and in the sharing of personal experiences.</p>
<p>Our aims are to help our girls to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop self-awareness, build healthy self-esteem and gain healthy perspectives
and values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop confidence and hone leadership skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in physical recreation to develop poise and a positive and
persevering attitude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn new practical skills for life-long learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to relate to others and work in teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture a spirit of empathy and to love and care for our home, community,
country and the world</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Zhonghua Secondary School’s 48th Girls’ Brigade company, members are
given various opportunities to cultivate meaningful pursuits and hone their
dispositions through the planning of weekly Parade activities and through
active contribution in their committee work. Our company’s programmes have
fostered key attributes such as confidence, teamwork, and resilience in
each one of our girls. Members forge close relationships with other girls
across the different levels, and with their officers and teachers. This
camaraderie has allowed the girls to learn from one another, inspire their
peers and work effectively together.</p>
