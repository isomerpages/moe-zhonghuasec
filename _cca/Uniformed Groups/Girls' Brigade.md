_‘Every Girl a Leader, Every Officer a Servant Leader.’_  These words guide every girl in the 48th Company Girls’ Brigade in Zhonghua Secondary School to serve to their fullest potential.  Members of the Girls’ Brigade are imbued with good moral values through involvement in various service-learning activities and sharing of personal experiences.

In the Girls’ Brigade, members are given various opportunities to hone their leadership skills and dispositions through the planning of games, weekly Parade activities and in committee work. Our company’s programmes have fostered in our girls attributes like confidence, team work and resilience. The weekly Parade encompasses recreational activities, badgework, foot drills and character building activities. Members also take part in the annual GB camp which challenges them to step out of their comfort zones to experience outdoor activities. Members of Girls’ Brigade also participate actively in national events such as the Girls’ Brigade Friendship Day and the Dr Low Guat Tin (LGT) Challenge. The competitions inculcate a strong sense of discipline and a spirit of excellence in the girls. 

Members forge close relationships with others across different levels, and with their officers and teachers. This camaraderie has allowed the girls to learn from one another, inspire their peers and work effectively together.

#### **Significant Achievements:**
For the past few years, the Company has consecutively achieved the Company Gold Award, which is a testament of the girls’, officers’, and teachers’ hard work in striving for excellence.
