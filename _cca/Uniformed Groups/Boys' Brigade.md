The Boys’ Brigade is one of the oldest uniformed groups in Singapore. Members of the Boys’ Brigade at Zhonghua Secondary School engage in meaningful programmes which build their strengths at leading and serving. With a strong emphasis on leadership development, team building, life skills, adventure activities, and community service, the boys enjoy a plethora of fun, meaningful and challenging programmes for their holistic development centered on good character-building values passed down from a Christian tradition.

In the 48th Company Boys’ Brigade, the boys get to experience a wide range of activities that challenge them to leave their comfort zones and grow in character and leadership qualities. They are also encouraged through to grow a global mindset, and consider and execute solutions to world issues. We have a tradition of boys mentoring boys, building a camaraderie of brotherhood that encourages giving back after receiving guidance from seniors.
