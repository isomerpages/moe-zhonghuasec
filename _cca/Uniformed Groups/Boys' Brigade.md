<p>Zhonghua Secondary School is proud to have the oldest uniform group, Boys’
Brigade, as one of the CCA offering. With a strong emphasis on leadership
development, team building, life skills, adventure activities and community
service, the boys enjoy a plethora of fun, meaningful and challenging programmes
for their holistic development centred on good character-building values
passed down from a Christian tradition.</p>
<p>In the 48th Company Boys’ Brigade, the boys get to experience a wide range
of activities that challenges them to get out of their comfort zone and
grow in character and leadership qualities. They are also encouraged through
the new curriculum to have a global mindset, considering solutions to world
issues and being part of that solution. We have a tradition of mentoring
within the CCA which builds a camaraderie of brotherhood that encourages
the gift of giving back.</p>
