Zhonghua Secondary School is proud to have the oldest uniform groups, Boys’ Brigade, as one of our CCA offerings. With a strong emphasis on leadership development, team building, life skills, adventure activities and community service, the boys enjoy a plethora of fun, meaningful and challenging programmes for their holistic development centred on good character-building values passed down from a Christian tradition. 

In the 48th Company Boys’ Brigade, the boys get to experience a wide range of activities that challenge them to leave their comfort zones and grow in character and leadership qualities. They are also encouraged through to grow a global mindset, and consider and execute solutions to world issues. We have a tradition of boys mentoring boys, building a camaraderie of brotherhood that encourages giving back after receiving guidance from seniors.
