Zhonghua Secondary School is proud to have the oldest uniform group, Boys’ Brigade, as one of the CCA offering. With a strong emphasis on leadership development, team building, life skills, adventure activities and community service, the boys enjoy a plethora of fun, meaningful and challenging programmes for their holistic development centred on good character-building values passed down from a Christian tradition.

In the 48th Company Boys’ Brigade, the boys get to experience a wide range of activities that challenges them to get out of their comfort zone and grow in character and leadership qualities. They are also encouraged through the new curriculum to have a global mindset, considering solutions to world issues and being part of that solution. We have a tradition of mentoring within the CCA which builds a camaraderie of brotherhood that encourages the gift of giving back.
