Zhonghua Secondary School’s St. John Brigade (SJB) was founded on 25th July 1961. The core focus of SJB is to develop the character and leadership qualities of cadets, in addition to imparting First Aid knowledge. 

SJB activities seek to inculcate an all-rounded education by developing personal skills and expanding knowledge of First Aid through weekly trainings, training camps and outdoor activities. Cadets are taught to be self-disciplined, responsible, persevering and to display team spirit. Our trainings equip cadets in knowledge and skills on First Aid, Transportation of Casualty, Home Nursing and Foot Drills. During these training sessions, our cadets are given the opportunity to hone their leadership skills. Our cadets provide First Aid services during school events and to the community. These public duties enable our cadets to put their knowledge to practice, and allow them to gain more experience, thus becoming more confident first aiders.
