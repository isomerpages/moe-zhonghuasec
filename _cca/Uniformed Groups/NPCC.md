Zhonghua NPCC’s vision is for our cadets to graduate as Caring and Responsible Citizens. We provide numerous opportunities for our cadets to grow in a challenging environment, which in turn imbues them with leadership qualities, strong character, and civic, social, and moral values. The unit's motto, "**Strive for Excellence**," serves as the foundation upon which we build each cadet's character, and this motto also motivates them to work towards their best.

Cadets undergo various programmes and activities which equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions in areas such as law enforcement, leadership, resilience, national education, and personal development.

**Key Programmes:**
* Camp Resilience
* Police Knowledge &amp; Basic Law
* Leadership &amp; Mentoring Skills
* Anti-Narcotic Course (SANA)
* Community Safety and Security Prevention (CSSP)
* Police Youth Ambassador
* Crime Scene Investigation (CSI)
* Road Safety Course

**Recent Achievements:**
* Unit Overall Proficiency Award 2022 – Gold
* e-CSI Competition 2021
* Area Base Campcraft Competition 2020
