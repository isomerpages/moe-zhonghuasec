Zhonghua Secondary NPCC Unit believes in developing our cadet’s character, leadership and resilience. Hence, our unit NPCC’s vision is for our cadets to graduate as Caring and Responsible Citizens. We provide numerous opportunities for our cadets to grow in a challenging environment, which in turn imbues them with leadership qualities, strong character, and civic, social, and moral values.

The unit’s motto, “**Together, Excellence**,” serves as the foundation upon which we build each cadet’s character, and this motto also motivates them to work towards their best.

We work towards ensuring that all the cadets have a fulfilling experience discovering about themselves and learning skills that will be useful for the future.
