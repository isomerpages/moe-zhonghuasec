<p>Zhonghua Secondary NPCC Unit believes in developing our cadet’s character,
leadership and resilience. Hence, our unit NPCC’s vision is for our cadets
to graduate as Caring and Responsible Citizens. We provide numerous opportunities
for our cadets to grow in a challenging environment, which in turn imbues
them with leadership qualities, strong character, and civic, social, and
moral values.</p>
<p>The unit’s motto, “<strong>Together, Excellence</strong>,” serves as the
foundation upon which we build each cadet’s character, and this motto also
motivates them to work towards their best.</p>
<p>We work towards ensuring that all the cadets have a fulfilling experience
discovering about themselves and learning skills that will be useful for
the future. Our cadets undergo various programmes and activities which
equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions in areas such as
law enforcement, leadership, resilience, national education, and personal
development.</p>
