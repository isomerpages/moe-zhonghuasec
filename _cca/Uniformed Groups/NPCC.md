The National Police Cadet Corps provides numerous opportunities for our cadets to grow in a challenging environment, which, in turn, imbibes them with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values. The unit’s motto, “Strive For Excellence”, lays the foundation on which we build every cadet’s character, and this motto also motivates them to work towards their best. We are able to achieve these by exposing our cadets to various courses and programmes. We believe that through the comprehensive NPCC framework, our cadets will graduate from Zhonghua NPCC as caring and responsible citizens.   

Cadets have shown great resilience in adapting to face the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. New training approaches such as conducting online courses and other digital platforms have helped cadets to achieve their goals and grow their knowledge and skillsets.
