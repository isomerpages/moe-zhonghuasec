Why Scouting? Scouting is about fun, adventure, and discovery. Scouting is also about achievements, brotherhood and sisterhood, friendship and leadership. 

The Zhonghua Scout Group was started in 2000, with our first intake of Girl Scouts in 2011.
Our Scouts are well-versed in pioneering skills where they learn to build structures like towers, bridges and playgrounds using wooden poles and with their knowledge of knots and lashings. Orienteering and backwoodsman cooking are other skills that our Scouts learn over the course of their scouting journey. Besides these core skills, our Scouts are also exposed to sports like kayaking, archery, night cycling and rock climbing.

Besides annual camps, the Zhonghua Scout Group regularly visits neighbouring countries to interact with, and learn from Scouts there. We have held exchanges with Scout troops in such countries as Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan. 

Our Scout group has performed well over the years. We have won the Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards for National Pioneering competitions, National Orienteering competitions and National Patrol Camps. To date, our Scouts have achieved 15 Gold and 3 Silver awards in the prestigious Frank Cooper Sands Award.
