<p>Scouting is about fun, adventure, and discovery. Scouting is also about
achievement, brotherhood and sisterhood, friendships, and leadership.</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Scout Group was started in 2000, with our first intake of
Girl Scouts in 2011. Our Scouts are well-versed in pioneering skills where
they learn to build structures like towers, bridges, and playgrounds using
wooden poles and with their knowledge of knots and lashings. Orienteering
and backwoodsman cooking are other skills that our Scouts learn over the
course of their scouting journey. Besides these core skills, our Scouts
are also exposed to sports like kayaking, archery, bowling, and rock climbing.</p>
<p>Besides annual camps, the Zhonghua Scout Group regularly visits neighboring
countries to interact with and learn from Scouts there. We have held exchanges
with Scout troops in countries such as Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam,
and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Our Scout Group has performed well in national competitions over the years.
We have achieved Silver and Gold Awards for National Patrol Camps and Silver
for the National Pioneering competition. To date, our Scouts have attained
16 Gold and 3 Silver awards in the prestigious Frank Cooper Sands Award.</p>
