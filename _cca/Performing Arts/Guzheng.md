Zhonghua Secondary School’s Guzheng Ensemble was formed in 1994 with the aim of promoting traditional Chinese music and developing young and skilful Guzheng players. The Ensemble is a platform for our students to showcase their interest, talent and skills at school and community events.&nbsp;

Members of the Guzheng Ensemble do not just grow in technical abilities and musicianship; they pick up important skills and dispositions such as communication, discipline, teamwork, perseverance and leadership.&nbsp; The time spent together during CCA practices, performances, and teambuilding activities also enables students to forge strong bonds with one another.
