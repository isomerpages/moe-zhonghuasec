<p>Zhonghua Secondary School’s Guzheng Ensemble was formed in 1994 with the
aim of promoting traditional Chinese music and developing young and skilful
Guzheng players. The Ensemble is a platform for our students to showcase
their interest, talent and skills at school and community events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the Guzheng Ensemble do not just grow in technical abilities
and musicianship; they pick up important skills and dispositions such as
communication, discipline, teamwork, perseverance and leadership.&nbsp;
The time spent together during CCA practices, performances, and teambuilding
activities also enables students to forge strong bonds with one another.</p>
