The Zhonghua Guzheng Ensemble currently boasts a strength of 70 members. We aim to cultivate an appreciation of and interest in Guzheng, and also to promote zheng music among our members.  

Under the guidance of Ms Cui Jingyi, the Ensemble has grown from strength to strength in the past 18 years.
Guzheng Ensemble members showcase their skills and talents in school events and programmes, such as the Chinese New Year Celebrations, Open House, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Aesthetics Week.  These are meaningful experiences for our members to grow in their technical capabilities and musical versatility. They also provide valuable opportunities for our students to develop important values and dispositions like resilience, teamwork and confidence.
