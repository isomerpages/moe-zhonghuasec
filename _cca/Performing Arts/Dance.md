Dance members gain exposure to and expertise in a variety of genres and techniques in Chinese Dance, and have opportunities to experience other dance genres like Hip Hop, K-Pop and Contemporary Dance. Through the CCA, our members grow not just in technique, poise, and form, but learn choreography as well.
