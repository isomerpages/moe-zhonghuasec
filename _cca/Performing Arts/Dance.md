#### **Significant Achievements:**

* Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2019: Certificate of Distinction 
* Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2021: Certificate of Accomplishment 

2021-2022 was an immensely fruitful year for Dance. Despite the restrictions posed by the Covid-19 pandemic on our choreography, our dancers demonstrated adaptability and resilience and performed their best in Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2021, achieving the Certificate of Accomplishment! 

Dance members gain exposure to and expertise in a variety of genres and techniques in Chinese Dance, and have opportunities to experience other dance genres. Through the CCA, our members grow not just in technique, poise, and form, but acquire values like resilience and teamwork.

Chinese Dance contributes to the school and wider community by performing for numerous events, such as the Chinese New Year and Teachers’ Day concerts.
