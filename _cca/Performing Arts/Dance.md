<p>Dance members gain exposure to and expertise in a variety of genres and
techniques in Chinese Dance, and have opportunities to experience other
dance genres like Hip Hop, K-Pop and Contemporary Dance. Through the CCA,
our members grow not just in technique, poise, and form, but learn choreography
as well.</p>
<p>Performing at school and community events provides our students with exposure
and experience, and hones important skills and dispositions like resilience,
discipline, communication, and teamwork.</p>
