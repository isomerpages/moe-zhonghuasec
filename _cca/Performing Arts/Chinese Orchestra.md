Zhonghua Chinese Orchestra seeks to provide a platform for young and interested musicians to learn and share their passion for traditional Chinese music. With most of our new members having little or no prior musical background, the Orchestra provides a nurturing and exciting environment for our members to develop an appreciation for Chinese music and culture.

Throughout their journey with the Orchestra, members learn personal responsibility, teamwork, and mental resilience through a myriad of programmes that extend beyond music. We also aim to nurture leadership competencies in our students by offering members opportunities to lead and guide their peers and as ambassadors of our CCA.

The Orchestra performs publicly, and in numerous school-based events and celebrations. These are valuable opportunities to reach out to the wider community and share the joy of Chinese music with others.

The Orchestra has performed consistently well in major music competitions since its inception.
