Zhonghua Chinese Orchestra (ZHCO) was founded in 2001 with only 13 members. Over the years, we have grown from strength to strength to become one of the most popular CCAs in the school with over 100 members currently. 

The promotion of the appreciation of Chinese music and culture is one of our primary aims, all the more so since most or our new members enter with little or no musical background or experience. In ZHCO, we also inculcate a strong sense of personal responsibility, teamwork and mental resilience through a myriad of activities beyond music. ZHCO hones the leadership qualities of our members by offering them opportunities to lead and guide their peers and as ambassadors of our CCA and school. 

ZHCO participates in numerous school-based events and in public performances, which provide our students with a platform to grow in confidence and to showcase their talents. These are also opportunities to reach out to the wider community and to share the joy of Chinese music with them. 

We value each member of ZHCO and we ensure that each of them graduate from the school with an invaluable, enriching and memorable experience.
