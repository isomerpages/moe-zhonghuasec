<p>ZWinds, established in 1987, focuses on nurturing our students’ hearts
and minds through music-making, cultivating active listening, perseverance
and team spirit.</p>
<p>Through learning and working together in their sections, members not only
learn to make music, they also cultivate skills and dispositions like effective
communication, relationship management and social awareness, which help
them to develop into effective leaders. Performing together as a full band
develops confidence whilst creating opportunities for the band members
to foster camaraderie.</p>
<p>ZWinds has always been one big family. We show care and appreciation to
one another and motivate each other to develop to our fullest potential
while keeping alive the passion we have for music.</p>
