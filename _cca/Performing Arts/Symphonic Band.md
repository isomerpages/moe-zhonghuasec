ZWinds, established in 1987, focuses on nurturing our students’ hearts and minds through music-making, cultivating active listening, perseverance and team spirit.

Through learning and working together in their sections, members not only learn to make music, they also cultivate skills and dispositions like effective communication, relationship management and social awareness, which help them to develop into effective leaders. Performing together as a full band develops confidence whilst creating opportunities for the band members to foster camaraderie.

ZWinds has always been one big family. We show care and appreciation to one another and motivate each other to develop to our fullest potential while keeping alive the passion we have for music.
