ZWinds was established in 1987, and is currently under the guidance of Mr Pip Tang for the Senior Band, and Mr Daniel Ong for the Junior Band. The Band has 112 members. At the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the Band was awarded the Certificate of Distinction. 

ZWinds has actively supported various community events such as the Braddell Heights National Day Celebration Dinner, the St John Brigade Annual General Inspection and the Singapore International Band Festival Outreach Performance. 

Zwinds focuses on nurturing our students’ hearts and minds through music-making, cultivating active listening, perseverance and team spirit. Working together in groups builds social skills and performing as a band develops confidence whilst creating more opportunities for the band members to foster camaraderie.

Zwinds has always been one big family. We show care and appreciation to one another and motivate each other to develop to their fullest potential while keeping alive the passion we have for music.
