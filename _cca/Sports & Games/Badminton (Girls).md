<p>In Zhonghua Secondary School’s Badminton, we believe in giving every member
an opportunity to give her best and display her competitive spirit, even
if they have little or no experience in sports at all. The team is made
up of a relatively small group of 45 girls and most of the girls were selected
through yearly Sec 1 trials. We also welcome Primary 6 girls, who had represented
their primary schools for zonal Badminton competitions and shared our school
values to be part of our school team, once they have successfully cleared
the DSA interviews for Primary 6 students. We witness with pride the development
of the girls in agility, confidence and resilience during the competitions
pitting against stronger contenders from other schools during the National
School Games in B and C Divisions.</p>
<p>Trainings are usually held on Mondays and Thursdays after lessons whereas
game sessions during holiday trainings occasionally include few friendly
matches with other schools. Weekly trainings are conducted by experienced
coaches, who closely with the teachers in charge.</p>
