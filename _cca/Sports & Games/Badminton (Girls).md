In Zhonghua Secondary School’s Badminton, we believe in giving every member an opportunity to give her best and display her competitive spirit, even if they have little or no experience in sports at all. The team is made up of a relatively small group of 45 girls and most of the girls were selected through yearly Sec 1 trials. We also welcome Primary 6 girls, who had represented their primary schools for zonal Badminton competitions and shared our school values to be part of our school team, once they have successfully cleared the DSA interviews for Primary 6 students. We witness with pride the development of the girls in agility, confidence and resilience during the competitions pitting against stronger contenders from other schools during the National School Games in B and C Divisions.

Trainings are usually held on Mondays and Thursdays after lessons whereas game sessions during holiday trainings occasionally include few friendly matches with other schools. Weekly trainings are conducted by experienced coaches, who closely with the teachers in charge.
