The Badminton CCA strives to prepare our members for the best possible performance in badminton competitions. Our members undergo tactical trainings guided by experienced coaches, which help them to gain more knowledge about rules and confidence in executing strokes of the badminton game. Trainings are also aimed at sharpening their wit and responses to bring out the best in their abilities in the badminton court. In the South Zone Badminton Championship 2022, our B Division girls gave their best and persevered when playing against other school teams.
