<p>Zhonghua Basketball Girl’s team is more than just a female basketball
team, this team has consistently achieved notable results since 1960s.
One of the reasons why is because we are guided by our school’s motto (礼义廉耻
- Courteous in Conduct; Righteous in Principle; Edified in Character; and
Dignified in Reflection). It is our vision to develop a basketball team
that embodies the school's core values of resilience, integrity, care,
and excellence.</p>
<p>We believe that a caring environment would allow the girls to support
and encourage one another, and they learn to respect and appreciate each
other's differences. They will also learn to care for their bodies by staying
active and healthy, which is vital for their overall well-being.</p>
<p>Recognising that every girl who has been selected to join the team will
come with her unique combinations of strengths and weaknesses, we are committed
to provide each member with the opportune guidance and training so that
she learns to push herself to strive for excellence.</p>
<p>Hard work and determination are key ingredients to improve and succeed
in sports. By practicing and working together as a team, the girls learn
the value of persistence and resilience in achieving their goals.</p>
<p>In the sporting arena, there are limitless opportunities for character
development. The girls are expected to follow the rules and play fairly,
even when the stakes are high. Honesty and sportsmanship are crucial qualities
in the sport and in life, and it has always been our goal for our girls
to grow into women of moral integrity.</p>
