In 2022, our ‘B’ Division basketball girls took part in the South Zone ‘B’ Division Girls National School Games 2022. They trained rigorously and persevered through every match. Their immense support for each other helped them through the challenging season. Their resilience and tenacity are highly commendable, and these are values which the ‘C’ Division basketball girls certainly aspire to emulate.

Besides the camaraderie and teamwork forged on the court, the basketball team engages regularly in teambuilding and team-bonding activities. A highlight of the 2022 basketball day camp was an invigorating kayaking experience at the Pandan Reservoir.

In 2021 and 2020, the National School Games for Basketball were cancelled. Undeterred, E-CCA programmes were conducted in lieu of face-to-face training. In 2021, the basketball girls also held their first intra-CCA Basketball CCA tournament.
