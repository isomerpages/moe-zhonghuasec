The Zhonghua Secondary School Table Tennis (Boys) team focuses on developing sportsmen with resilience and discipline. Players undergo a rigorous and demanding training programme to stretch them physically and mentally, and to foster social skills, values and dispositions in them.

Our training sessions comprise a series of fitness, skill-related drills and set-play practices. Players strive to continuously improve themselves, not just as athletes, but also in character. They take&nbsp;**Responsibility**&nbsp;for their learning, demonstrate&nbsp;**Integrity**&nbsp;in their sportsmanship, practise&nbsp;**Care**&nbsp;for their teammates and pursue&nbsp;**Excellence**&nbsp;by giving their all.

**Recent Achievements:**
