The Zhonghua Secondary School Table Tennis (Boys) CCA was started in 2018. 

The table tennis team focuses on developing sportsmen with resilience and discipline. Players undergo a rigorous and demanding training programme to stretch them physically and mentally, and to foster social skills, values and dispositions in them. 

Our training sessions comprise a series of fitness, skill-related drills and set-play practices. Players strive to continuously improve themselves, not just as athletes, but also in character. They taking Responsibility for their learning, demonstrate Integrity in their sportsmanship, practise Care for their teammates and pursue Excellence by giving their all. 

To most people, table tennis is just a sport. In Zhonghua, table tennis is more than a sport – it’s an art.
