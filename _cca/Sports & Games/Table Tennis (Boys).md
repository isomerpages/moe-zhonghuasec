<p>The Zhonghua Secondary School Table Tennis (Boys) team focuses on developing
sportsmen with resilience and discipline. Players undergo a rigorous and
demanding training programme to stretch them physically and mentally, and
to foster social skills, values and dispositions in them.</p>
<p>Our training sessions comprise a series of fitness, skill-related drills
and set-play practices. Players strive to continuously improve themselves,
not just as athletes, but also in character. They take&nbsp;<strong>Responsibility</strong>&nbsp;for
their learning, demonstrate&nbsp;<strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;in their
sportsmanship, practise&nbsp;<strong>Care</strong>&nbsp;for their teammates
and pursue&nbsp;<strong>Excellence</strong>&nbsp;by giving their all.</p>
