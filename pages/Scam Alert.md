<h3><strong><u>Scam Alert: Impersonation Phone Calls</u></strong></h3>
<h4>We have been alerted to incidents where members of the public, including contractors and other companies and vendors, have received phone calls from individuals attempting to impersonate staff of Zhonghua Secondary School. Impersonators have also provided fake name cards and name tags with the school name as verification of their identity.</h4>
<p><strong>Beware of these scam phone calls:</strong>

<p>They come from both local and overseas numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the callers claim to require purchases (e.g. paint, curtains,
mattresses etc) and/or arrange a site visit to the school. But they require
the companies / vendors to transfer money to another company/ their own
company in order to purchase required material first.</p>
