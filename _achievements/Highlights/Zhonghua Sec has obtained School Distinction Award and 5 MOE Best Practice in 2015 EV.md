### **CONGRATULATIONS ZHONGHUARIANS!**

<img src="/images/congrats%20zhonghuarians.jpg" style="width:55%">

Our school underwent an External Validation Exercise from 26 Feb to 2 Mar 2015 this year led by a team comprising MOE officials from the Schools Appraisal Branch, Principals, Cluster Superintendents and Heads of Departments.   We are proud to announce that our autonomous school status has been renewed for the next 6 years (2015 – 2020) and we have once again been awarded the **_School Distinction Award_**!  We have also been recognised for all the 5 Best Practices accorded by MOE, namely **_Teaching and Learning_**, **_Student All-Round Development_**, **_Character and Citizenship_** **_Education, Staff Well-Being and Development_** and **_Partnership_**!  This validation exercise has re-affirmed that we are an institution of excellence not only in the area of the academics but also in providing a myriad of rich learning experiences for our Zhonghuarians guided by sound values and a sense of mission!  We are grateful for our committed internal stakeholders (parents, members of the School Advisory Committee, alumni) and external strategic partners in support of our educational endeavours. We are poised now to soar in our next lap of the school’s journey to develop _Scholars and Leaders of the Future_!   Well done everyone!
