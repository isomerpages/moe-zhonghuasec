On 8th March 2016, our 3N1 and 3T1 students attended the \`Future of Us’ Exhibition. They were accompanied by teachers, namely, Mr Seah Kim Weng, Miss Estee Teo, Mr Zafir and Miss Charissa Lee. The objectives of the learning journey were to allow students to take a step into the past, see what Singapore was like and how our nation has overcome its challenges to enjoy what we have today. The students also caught a glimpse of what the future may be like in the next 50 years. To ensure that Singapore remains a liveable city, our young ones will have to innovate and come up with creative ideas to forge a future for us all. Below are some excerpts of the students’ reflections:

#### **Learning from the past: What can we learn from our pioneers who have helped to build Singapore?**
“We learn to always lend a helping hand and be the first voice that inspires actions from people. We also learn not to repeat past mistakes.” **– Gerson Tham, 3N1**

“We learn not to give up easily and work harder, just like our pioneers who faced problems when they helped to build Singapore. They never stopped trying or gave up. They worked harder and these attitudes led them to success.” **– Ariel Wang, 3N1**

“We learn the importance of care and integrity because we should help out and care for people in need. In this way, we can live peacefully and harmoniously together so that Singapore remains a united nation. We should persevere to overcome all the obstacles that we face now and not give up easily because most problems can be solved. We must overcome all odds to make Singapore a better place.”**– Shirley Ser, 3T1**

#### **Select an innovation that impressed you in the exhibition. What issue was it trying to address?**
