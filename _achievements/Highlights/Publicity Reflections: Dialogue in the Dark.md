### **Publicity Reflections: Dialogue in the Dark**

<img src="/images/dialogueinthedark.jpg" style="width:65%">

Most of the things that I could do every day with much ease suddenly became difficult. I finally understood what life is like for a visually impaired person through this experience. I admire their courage to continue exploring the world and their drive to remain independent despite their difficulties. Through the Dialogue in the Dark activity, I learn to ‘see’ differently. I also learn the importance of team work – to help one another and be less judgemental – so that the team can thrive.<br>

Going through Dialogue in the Dark made me realise the daily difficulties of the visually impaired. I learn to cherish my 5 senses, especially my sight as it is so easy to take it for granted. I have also learnt that disabilities do not define us. It is our attitude that defines us. Our guide, Uncle Gary, is fully blind, but his zest for life is inspiring and admirable.<br>

I felt scared being in complete darkness and having only the guide’s voice and the walking stick to guide me around. There were times when it was scary to even take a step forward because I was uncertain of what was ahead. Through this I have learnt that having sight is a huge blessing. It is also important to put ourselves into the shoes of the visually impaired because it is not easy to do regular everyday things in complete darkness. I have also learnt that although being visually impaired may be a huge challenge, it is important to always be optimistic and positive because one can learn to adapt. There is always a solution to any problem.<br>

I was confused and scared at first as I did not know what to expect. However, after meeting our guide, Uncle Thomas, I felt a lot more secure and safe. As I could not see anything, there was a lingering fear that I would stray away from the group. Thankfully, my group mates were always calling out for one another, and we were able to complete our journey. Through this, I learnt that all of us have our strengths and weaknesses. Whenever we work in a group, we should tap on one another’s strength so that we can rely on each other in order to make up for our weaknesses. We would be more effective and efficient if we all work together and help each other out.<br>

During Dialogue in the Dark, I felt vulnerable as I was unable to use my sense of sight to navigate the enclosed space that we were in. Without sight, I had to rely on my other senses such as the sense of touch and hearing. Through this activity, I learn to respect the visually impaired. I can also empathise with them as I got to step into their shoes for that day and learn the hardship of having to live in darkness. I have also learnt from the guide that we should not focus on our weaknesses and limitations. Instead, we should leverage on our strengths to improve our lives.<br>

At the start, it was hard to get used to the darkness and we was unable to anticipate what lay ahead. Thankfully, our guide was able to guide as with his voice. He gave us specific instructions and made us feel our surroundings. Through this activity, I have learnt to put myself in the shoes of a visually impaired person. I was able to better understand their difficulties. I have also realised that one should not just focus on his disability. Even when one is impaired in one way, we should be grateful for the other working senses as they can also serve us well.<br>
