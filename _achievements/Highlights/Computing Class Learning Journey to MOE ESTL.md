### **Computing Class Learning Journey to MOE ESTL**

<img src="/images/computing%20class.jpg" style="width:65%">

Computing students from 3E3 visited the MOE Experimental Systems Technology Laboratory (ESTL) on Tuesday 22 Jan 2019 as part of their learning journey experience. Here is a short reflection from Ryan Ng.  
  
The learning journey to MOE ESTL allowed us to gain a better understanding of the variety of jobs and pathways available in the IT field. We learnt that Computing is actually only the tip of the iceberg for all the various fields available. Even though the path to working life may be hard, we have to persevere and be determined to overcome all difficulties.  
  
We also had the opportunity to meet the NUS Professor, Dr Ben Leong, who answered all our questions and talked about his journey too. Finally, the most important learning was that no matter what jobs we take up in the future, everyone has to play a part to achieve success, as there is no one-man job.
