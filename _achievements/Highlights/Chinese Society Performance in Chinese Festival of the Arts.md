### **Chinese Society Performance in Chinese Festival of the Arts**

After countless practices with Mdm Fan, our Chinese Drama coach, I feel more confident as my skill in acting has improved considerably. 

How do I know that? This is largely because I am not nervous when I am acting onstage. During the Chinese Festival of the Arts, I was able to express how my character was supposed to feel. I was not paying attention to the crowd. I was able to fully concentrate on my acting.

Through this experience, aside from learning how to speak confidently, I have also learnt other essential values such as resilience and perseverance. Even though I was frequently chastised by Mdm Fan, I was able to take her scolding in good stride. I know she only scolded me because she could see the potential in me and want me to improve my craft. There were moments when I was upset by her negative feedback. However, I took the opportunity to reflect. This was indeed a humbling experience. Not only have I become a better actor, I have also become a better person. I am truly grateful to Mdm Fan for her guidance. 

Aside from taking part in this prestigious Chinese Festival of Arts at the Esplanade, I am also thankful to have been given the opportunity to take part in the storytelling competition the previous year. I would also like to express gratitude to Mr Yang Bin for giving me opportunities to gain new experience, to hone my skills as an a actor.<br>

万万没想到还能有机会被邀请到滨海艺术中心面对观众进行表演。这说明我们的表演受到大家的认可，我感到非常荣幸。这个舞台给了我们宝贵的机会，让更多的人认识中华中学，认识中华中学的中文学会。

在表演现场，我们的作品得到了现场观众的共鸣，虽然台下的观众有着不同的社会背景，但我们的故事触动了他们心灵的最深处，有些老人家，甚至还拿出来手帕默默擦去眼泪。

专业的表演场地开阔了我的视野，让我接触到了专业的音响设备，也让我有机会和专业人士合作。

我为自己，为我们中学学会，更为我们学校感到骄傲！<br>
