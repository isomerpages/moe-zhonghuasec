### **Learning Journey to MOE ESTL**
The Secondary 3 Computing (‘O’ Level) students were invited by Dr Ben Leong, who is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC), for a learning journey to the Ministry of Education’s Experimental Systems and Technology Laboratory (MOE ESTL) on 24 January 2017.

The learning journey served as an excellent opportunity for the students to meet the team spearheading the subject they are learning. It was also an eye-opening experience for the students to observe and explore MOE ESTL’s office off Ghim Moh Road. An introduction by various members of the team kick-started the journey, providing the students with a brief insight to the team’s daily life such as what a back-end programmer faces.

The students were also able to converse with Dr Ben Leong, who is also the Director of MOE ESTL, to have an idea of what are expected and debunking misconceptions of what the students have of the subject and industry. 

Below is a reflection written by one of the students.

“This learning journey to the MOE ESTL allowed us to get to know more about the diverse jobs available in the computing industry. It also shows us that certain jobs can be related to computing, such as those from the security and infrastructure sector. We learnt that making a Working Application requires a lot of hard work and determination. It also requires various skills from people working in different sectors. Therefore, everyone has a part to play to ensure that the programme works. We also had a great chance to meet the Professor from NUS School of Computing, Dr Ben Leong. He clarified the doubts that we had and we greatly enjoyed the time we had with him. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and we learnt a lot more about the world of computing.”
