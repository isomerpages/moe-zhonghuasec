It is a dream come true to obtain the highest possible achievement that we can achieve in St John. Obtaining the Chief Commissioner’s badge means a lot to me as I have gone through many arduous hurdles to obtain this badge.

I vividly remember that during the advanced non-commissioner course, I took up the role as a triage in-charge when nobody wanted to. I had to take responsibility for a team of over 100 cadets in the rescue of casualties during a simulated emergency. After taking up the role, I realised that it was crucial for a leader to be responsible and confident so that everyone else would listen to him.

The success of the entire simulation would have not been possible without the help of everyone from St John. Thank you for helping me grow more responsible in the process of obtaining this honorable badge.<br>

Having attained the most prestigious badge, I feel a greater sense of pride whenever I wear my uniform.

I had attended different courses and acquired different skills in my journey to attain the Chief Commissioner's badge. Skills such as the Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation enabled me to help people in times of emergency. It has helped me to grow not just as a first aider, but also as a person who is now capable to assist others in times of need.

This badge has also marked the end of my four years’ journey after acquiring the different badges in each of the four groups – Welfare & Services, Outdoor activities, Skills & Hobbies and General.

I am grateful to my seniors and the Teachers-in-charge who signed us up for the courses to equip us with so many useful skills.<br>
**_TESSLYN TEO SHUYI, 4E1_**

When I first stepped into Zhonghua’s St John, I had no idea about the innumerable skills and values that I would soon acquire. Upon becoming a St John cadet, I realised that St John is not merely about first aid. It also consists of other components like foot drill, home nursing, and many more. I have picked up a lot of medical knowledge and have had many opportunities to bond with my squad mates and strengthen our friendships.

These badges on our sleeves are not merely for show. They also serve as reminders of our achievements and the invaluable lessons we learnt upon accomplishing each course.

Looking back, I have zero regrets about my choice to become part of Zhonghua’s St John.<br>
**_PUI JIA YING, 4E1_**

I would not be able to achieve this award without the trust and support placed in me by my teachers as they've signed me up for courses and given me many opportunities to lead, of which I sincerely cherish. Together with a few of my year mates, we were very heartened to have accomplished top honours for ourselves and for the corp.

On reflection, this experience has been a fruitful one for me as it shaped my character. This journey is filled with ups and downs, and I am thankful for both. The former taught me to be humble while the latter has made me a stronger and more resilient person.<br>
**_MAVERICK TOH GIM LIN, 4E2_**

My year mates and I went through a hectic, enriching and memorable 4-years journey. Getting this badge was not an easy feat and I have to thank the teachers, officers and my seniors for helping us to achieve this badge.

In my view, getting the gold Chief Commissioner's badge that we don on our uniform is just a small reward. I believe that the bigger picture of this achievement is the memories and life skills we will remember for the rest of our lives, such as leadership and first aid.

All in all, it has been a wonderful 4 year journey, and our attainment of the Chief Commissioner badge is icing on the cake.<br>
**_WILLIAM HIZON ILMEDO, 4E2_**

It is a long journey to get to where I am now. It has been several months since I have stepped down from my various roles in St John Brigade (SJB). Looking back, I feel that it was a very exhausting, yet meaningful journey.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my squad mates for the 3-4 years of support and the times we have spent together. I may not have made it so far without them.

Secondly, I would like to thank the teachers-in-charge for signing us up for the different courses so that we could achieve this badge. Without the consistency and commitment, I doubt that I would be able to attain this badge.

In addition, I have also learnt different skills and knowledge that could be applied in our daily lives. In short, I am thankful that all these commitment and hard work paid off.<br>
**_MALCOLM ANG SHANG HUI, 4E3_**

I would not be able to obtain the Chief Commissioner’s badge without the support from the teachers-in-charge. The teachers signed me up for many different courses and spent a lot time with us, accompanying us when we attended the various courses.

In addition, they assisted me throughout the whole journey to ensure that Icould achieve the badge as early as possible.I feel a great sense of pride as the badge sparkles on my uniform.

As I persevered through the different courses to fulfil the badge requirements, I enhanced my first aid knowledge as well as learnt many useful life-long skills. I aspire to be a doctor in the future. Hence, skills such as performing _cardiopulmonary resuscitation_ (CPR) and using the _automated external defibrillator_ (AED) can come in handy in my future career.<br>
**_POON CHICK PIN JOHNSON, 4E3_**

I would not be able to achieving the Chief Commissioner badge without the help of the teachers-in-charge, my seniors and my year mates.

Firstly, I would like to thank our teachers-in-charge as they were the ones who helped us apply for various courses to participate and also took the effort to travel all the way to the St John Headquarters at Nicoll Highway to purchase our badges.

Secondly, I would like to thank my seniors as they had imparted many skills and values to us which enabled us to be ready for these courses. They definitely made sure that we were not only able to pass the courses but also learn something valuable from the process.

Lastly, I would like to thank my year mates who accompanied me through these courses. Learning together was fun and meaningful and I am glad we have fostered such great camaraderie during our times together.<br>
