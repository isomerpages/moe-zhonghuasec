#### **Students' Reflections:**
The dialogue with Guest Conductor Maestro Darrell Ang and Assistant Professor Chen Zhangyi was an interesting and enriching experience. I feel honoured to be given the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with the two eminent musicians on a range of topics related to music. Asst Prof Chen explained about the violin concerto which he composed and how it was linked to our National flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim and also a mini opera and how it was linked to theme of coffee. It was very inspiring to see how a composer was able to turn a simple thought such as a cup of coffee into an opera, full of rich sounds and beautiful, unique melodies. I had fun learning about how each piece was composed and I look forward to having another opportunity to learn from Maestro Darrell Ang and Asst Professor Chen Zhangyi.<br>

Overall, the dialogue with SSO Guest conductor Maestro Darrell Ang and Assistant Professor Dr Chen Zhangyi was a meaningful and fulfilling one. I gleaned new knowledge on music from this dialogue. The speakers touched on many subjects related to music, from harmonic (chord) progressions to the music industry in Singapore. The dialogue gave me more exposure on local composers, local music works and also local operas. Furthermore, the dialogue enabled me to be more informed in music if I decide to pursue a career in music. We also learnt that one can gain inspiration from anything for a music composition. We listened to Dr Chen Zhangyi's compositions, and he explained how he composed and where he got his inspiration from. In all, I enjoyed the dialogue and hope for more similar events in the future.<br>

After attending the dialogue with SSO guest conductor Maestro Darrell Ang and Assistant Professor Chen Zhangyi, I gained a deeper understanding on Singaporean compositions and how music works. From this dialogue, I learned that one can be inspired by anything or anyone at any time. From chord progressions to local music industries, this dialogue allowed me to understand the purpose of studying music and how the knowledge gleaned can be applied in the working world. We were also exposed to a few different pieces that were composed by Asst Prof Chen Zhangyi himself, which was a great experience. Furthermore, this dialogue got me to consider music as one of my choices in my future career path too. I hope to participate in similar dialogues in the future so as to gain a better understanding on composing and music.<br>
