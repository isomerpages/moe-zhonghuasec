### **STEM Festival 2018**
The inaugural STEM festival which showcased integrated projects and learning experiences of Zhonghuarians was held on 22nd March 2018. Everyone had a memorable experience visiting the booths and gaining insight into STEM education! Many thanks to Nanyang Polytechnic, Science Centre and PUB for their sharing which widened the perspectives of all the student participants.

Here are some of the reflections by the student participants:  
 
Manning our booth was very enjoyable as we had a constant crowd at the booth. Our project was well-accepted by many of the students, teachers and guests. It was very nice to know that a lot of people were genuinely interested in our project.  
  
We learnt to be patient with the audience as not everyone may be engaged in the presentation from the get go. We also learnt how to improvise and adapt our presentation depending on the audience. With every different type of audience, we would present our project in a slightly different manner. For example, with primary school students, we simplified our project for them. With teachers or guests, we explained our project in detail and elaborated on the aims and basis of the project. In addition, whenever we found that we did not have enough goggles or our guests did not have their mobile phones with them, we had to improvise by either using our own phones or introducing another part of our project first.  
  
On hindsight, we could have prepared more mobile phones for the audience. Many who visited our booth either did not have a phone, a QR code scanner or WiFi access. Besides the phones, we were also did not have sufficient Google goggles. Therefore, logistics wise, we could have done better. It was also a pity that we did not bring the posters that we had prepared for our booth, because the posters would have really helped to illustrate our statistics.  
Overall, even though it was tiring, it was a very interesting and enriching experience that we have gained a lot from.<br>

We were able to converse with various people about our experience during the work attachment programme even though our booth was not as aesthetically appealing. Many of them were quite interested to hear our personal takeaways and appeared to genuinely want to learn more. We were also able to impart knowledge to the students who visited our booth on whether they should participate in the programme in the future.  
  
We learnt how to interact with people of different ages. For example, I learnt that children at the primary school level and lower secondary level do not have as high an attention span as adults and we would need to avoid the complicated medical terms in order to hold their interest. The adults however, would pay close attention to the words that we say rather than just look at the poster and walk off. As we were taking turns to present, some of us were given the opportunity to walk around and view the other booths. We found that the use of VR goggles to view life as an autistic person at the Chung Ling booth was very interesting as it was our first time using the VR goggles. We learnt to improve on our social skills as well as gained knowledge from visiting the other booths.  
  
Something that we could improved on for our booth is the use of more pictures, such as putting the photograph that we got from the laboratory on the table of our booth to attract more students to come by and take a look. We could have also been more proactive in attracting more teachers and students to our booth.<br>

Both teachers and students were very interested in our Virtual Reality (VR) video and seem to find our booth educational and interesting. During the presentation, we were able to interact with the teachers and students.  
  
We learnt that VR can be used to make learning more efficient. Even though some students did not really understand the content of our booth, they could still relate to the parts which they learnt through the VR video. This allowed us to be able to connect with the students after understanding what they have learnt and we also shared more with them based on our knowledge of plant cells. VR can indeed make learning more fun and interesting. This event also allowed us to learn how to better communicate with people of different age groups.  
  
There are a few areas for improvement for our booth. Firstly, the content of our project could have been further simplified so that primary school students can understand the content of our booth. Secondly, we should have delegated tasks to every group member to ensure we were able to manage the crowd. In addition, we should have included the steps on how to activate the VR function, so as to aid students and teachers on how to use the QR code to watch the video. Lastly, we should have also thought of a way to gather feedback from the teachers and students to know what we did well and what the areas for improvement are.<br>

Many people especially the students from primary schools were very interested and enthusiastic at our booth. We succeeded in making our booth more interactive by having our own “graffiti board” and opinion board for the guests to draw on. Many students enjoyed the VR video we compiled and found it very cool and refreshing  
  
We learnt that during a presentation, we have to adapt to the different audience, and to present in different ways in order to cater to people with different levels of understanding. We believe that VR can be used as a teaching device and has many benefits. We also gained skills such as being confident when speaking to a crowd and innovate to capture our audience’s attention and interests.  
  
On hindsight, we could be clearer with what we wanted to convey and explain the background information of our project clearly to our audience.<br>
