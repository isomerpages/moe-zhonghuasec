### **Longmen Internationalisation Programme 2019**

During the trip to Taiwan, there were many interesting experiences but none more so than when my peers and I climbed Elephant Mountain. The overall hike was 15 to 20 minutes long and it was very tiring, but we were able to take some cool pictures together and bond with one another every step of the way. The group was split into three as we climbed. Eventually, I was able to reach the top of the 600 steps. In my mind, I kept wondering how long it took the locals to build, carve and establish every single step. They must have put in a great deal of time and effort to do so. When I finished the hike I was exhausted, but I felt particularly satisfied as I had never done something so difficult and challenging before. I have learnt from this experience that if I endure to the end and not give up so easily, I can accomplish many things.<br>

The best part of the Longmen TIE trip was definitely joining the students there for their lessons. Through the immersion, I realised how different the learning environment there was, with students being extremely participative and attentive as compared to the relatively more relaxed lessons we have here in Singapore. The students are well-prepared before a lesson begins, despite there being a short break between each lesson. This really surprised me as it strongly contrasted with how lessons here usually begin, a little later than they are supposed to as students or teachers may move from one venue to another. Of course, the lessons were conducted in full Chinese, which posed a great challenge to me as I am not proficient in it and had a hard time understanding the subjects being taught, especially the Chinese Language and Mathematics lessons, where everything seemed so familiar yet so strange.    
  
Another major difference was that rather than eating at a canteen, students would have different cooked meals brought to them every day to eat in the classroom. The thing that stood out for me, however, was the fact that the students expressed how they disliked the prepared food and much preferred the food served in a canteen like at Zhonghua Secondary School when they came here for their immersion trip; but students from our school thought the exact opposite. It is interesting how the grass is always greener on the other side! I was also amazed at the enormous size of their school, having to climb four storeys between lessons at times, or make our way to the basement level. Overall, I enjoyed the trip thoroughly and I would go for it again if given the opportunity.<br>

Taking part in the TIE trip to Taiwan gave me the opportunity to learn many different things. Firstly, it was the first time I was travelling alone without my parents. It allowed me to be more independent and learn to be less reliant on them. One of the most memorable activities was being able to visit a local school in Taiwan. I would not have been able to do so if I had visited Taiwan on my own. While we were there, we joined students for their lessons, which were really an eye-opener for me. The biggest difference between Taiwan and Singapore's education systems was definitely the language medium used to conduct lessons. Unlike Singapore, all lessons in Taiwan are conducted in Mandarin regardless of the subject. Although the things they learnt were similar to what we learn here, I did not understand many of the terms used by their teachers and struggled to keep up with the lessons. Thankfully, after consulting my Taiwanese buddy, I was able to get a clearer understanding of the lessons. This experience has allowed me to gain deeper insights into Taiwan’s education system and have the chance to interact with the people of a different country. Overall, the trip was a very enjoyable and fruitful one. Other than being able to know my friends better, I also developed a better understanding of Taiwanese culture.<br>

This trip was interesting for me as I got to go to some of Taiwan’s heritage sites and learn more about their culture. I felt that going on a cultural learning journey with the school has also enabled me to get better acquainted with my friends, especially when we need to look out for each other in a foreign country.  Furthermore, I would not have another opportunity to visit a school overseas and see for myself the differences in the approach that schools overseas take to teach their students compared to how things are done in Singapore schools. For instance, lessons are conducted in Mandarin in Taiwan. I did not understand some of the terms used, especially during Mathematics lesson. Occasionally, I had to consult my Taiwanese buddy to get a clearer idea of what was going on. Also, I recall we experimented with making ice-cream. I was surprised that the outcome was quite close to actual ice-cream! We were also allowed to taste it! Overall, I had a great and fruitful experience, and I would want nothing else in exchange for it.<br>
