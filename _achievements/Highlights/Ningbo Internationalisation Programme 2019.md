### **Ningbo Internationalisation Programme 2019**

<img src="/images/ningbo2019.jpg" style="width:65%">

In the school in Ningbo, I observed that the Chinese students would take initiative to clean their classroom after every lesson by sweeping the floor and cleaning the board. I was very impressed by the students as they exhibited great pride and responsibility in the maintenance of their classroom cleanliness. I hope that Zhonghua students would adopt a similar attitude. Aside from cleaning our classroom, we should also clear the plates, bowls and cutlery in the canteen, something that we regrettably are not consistent with.    
  
The Chinese students also participated in class discussions actively and would answer their teachers' questions enthusiastically. They were not shy to share their answers and as a result, the lessons were livelier. As I observed the lessons, I noticed that the students exchanged their ideas tactfully and did not belittle others’ opinions. Aside from that, it was also interesting to listen to the various perspectives of the students. It was altogether, a stimulating and enjoyable learning experience. Lastly, I learnt from my buddy that the students would do self-study even when they were not told to do so or if the teacher was absent for the day. I think that it is admirable that our Chinese friends are so hardworking and motivated. They are able to spend their time constructively and this is definitely very commendable.    
  
After my trip to Ningbo, China, my understanding of the Chinese culture has definitely deepened. China has a rich and long history, which is worth learning and exploring. What appeals most to me are the buildings and structures people built in the past and the meaning and innovation behind it. I also find the history behind the temples and other cultural places like the Xuedoushan area very fascinating. From this trip, I have learnt more about the history of China. Through the visits to the scenic sights and exchange programme with the Chinese school, I feel that I have also broadened my horizons. I was more aware of certain Chinese cultural practices unique to the natives. Not only have I learnt to better communicate with my fellow Zhonghua students, I also became more confident and brave as I interacted with the Chinese students. I also feel that I am more mindful and respectful of the different practices among different communities of people.<br>

There were many places that we went to during our trip in Ningbo. However, I had a very special experience in the school that we visited, Ningbo Foreign Language School, and the staff and students I met there. When we first arrived, I realised that all the students were very well-behaved in class. They were all seated properly and were listening attentively. The teacher did not have to raise her voice to remind the students to keep quiet. I was amazed by the students’ level of discipline. I feel that the learning environment was very conducive as the students are well-behaved and keen to learn.    
  
Another good practice I observed was that all the students took the initiative to do their allocated classroom duties. In-between lessons, the students automatically stood up and started cleaning and arranging the tables in the classroom without having the teachers to remind them to do so. We should learn from them as I think that many of us in Zhonghua are quite reluctant to do our assigned duties and clean up the classroom, which results in our classrooms becoming quite dirty. I feel that a clean classroom environment will not only allow us to study better, but also allow us to foster that sense of ownership of our classrooms.    
  
Another thing I noticed was that all the students returned their plates after eating their meals, which is a really good practice. This keeps the canteen clean and lightens the load of the elderly school cleaners as they do not need to go to every table to return the remaining plates and bowls. Personally, I do clean up and return my plates after my meals. However, I still see a handful of students not doing so. I will bear in mind to remind them to return their plates promptly.    
  
Besides the school, we visited other places in Ningbo too. After visiting all these different places, I realised that the people in China are very religious. There are many temples in Ningbo where the locals would pray to their gods. My Chinese buddies also explained to us that when we eat, we should not talk too much and put our feet on the chair as it is not very polite. After communicating and spending more time with them, I realised that we share numerous similarities with the local Chinese people and that they are very warm, friendly and hospitable towards us. It was, all in all, an eye-opening trip for me.<br>

A good practice I observed in Ningbo Foreign Language School was that the students were very enthusiastic in class. They were unafraid to speak up and clarify their doubts. I feel that this is very commendable as they were not afraid to make mistakes while learning. In fact, it was very clear that when the students clarified their doubts during lessons, their classmates also benefitted from their questions. I have also observed that the Chinese students were very focused throughout the day and no one talked among themselves during lessons. Most of the time during the last few periods of school, we would inevitably be tired and become more restless in class. I wish we could be more disciplined like the Chinese students and be on our best behavior at all times in school. I also feel that we should not be worried of how our peers would think of us and not be afraid to clarify our doubts with our teachers in class.    
  
The Chinese students in Ningbo were also very friendly. We were in a foreign school so we initially felt uncomfortable in this unfamiliar place. However, the students were very warm and welcoming, and they made us feel at ease. They did not hesitate to share with us about different aspects of the school. I felt a little embarrassed that we were not so open and warm when the Chinese students visited us, possibly because we were quite shy and inhibited. I have learnt from this trip to be more friendly and hospitable to foreign students who visit Zhonghua in the future. Through this Internationalisation Programme, I learn that we should respect and accept other cultures even if they are different from ours. When we are in a foreign country, we should be open-minded and should not expect the locals to behave just the way we want. We should be humble and seek to learn from others in order to improve.<br>
