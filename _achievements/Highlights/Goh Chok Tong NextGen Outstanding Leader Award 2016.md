Below are the reflections of our awardees.

I am delighted, honoured, and also humbled to be recognised for my leadership achievements in Zhonghua and my social/community volunteering efforts by our Emeritus Minister Goh Chok Tong. 

Firstly I would like to express my gratitude to the Student Council and teacher-mentors especially Ms Ong Lay Hong and Ms Tan Chye-I for placing their trust in me as a leader and giving me the opportunity to plan events with my fellow council mates. 

I would also like to thank the teachers and members of the Infocomm Club for having faith in me as a Team Leader. Their belief in me definitely motivated me further to develop my team and hone my abilities as a Student-Leader. 

My journey in Zhonghua as a Student-Leader has been a fruitful and enriching one and I wish my juniors and peers all the best in continuing their pursuit to be true scholars and leaders who will serve the nation. 

I would also like to thank my youth group for giving me the additional opportunities to volunteer and contribute back to society. Apart from that, they gave me the platform to lead and plan some of such events.

“Don’t just think about yourself in whatever you do in life. Step into the shoes of others before we speak or do anything,” my dad always reminds me. Even as we lead fast-paced lives, we should not forget the needs of our communities. I would like to thank my father who has instilled the fire of volunteerism in me. 

Since young, I have been accompanying him on the annual festivities such as Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn festival and Christmas to give out food hampers and red packets to lonely elderly, helping out at homes for seniors, and also engaging in conversations with them. Seeing their bright smiles on their faces is one reason that encourages me to keep on volunteering.

Last but not least I would like to thank my parents for always encouraging me to participate in community work; and my friends for supporting and joining me at times; as well as our teachers in school who allow every student to have the experience to give back to society and the community. I will continue to serve the community, especially the elderly and less privileged in order to make the country a better place to live in. I hope that in time to come, I would be able to influence more people to serve the community. “<br>
**Ng Yan Ting (4E1, 2016)**

Firstly, I would like to thank the school for giving me a chance to lead others and recognising my efforts in being a leader. Next, I would also like to express my appreciation towards the Monitor Board and Student Council teachers-in-charge, especially Ms Faith Ahino and Ms Subathra, for guiding me as a leader and giving me advice to improve. 

In addition, I would like to thank my band conductor, Mr Anthony Chew, and my band teachers-in-charge, especially Mr Seah Kim Weng, for having trust in me to lead the band and developing my leadership skills. 

Lastly, I would also like to thank my family and friends for their care and support.<br>
**Wayne Lim (4E3, 2016)**

It was an honour to receive the Goh Chok Tong NextGen Leadership Award, and I am gratified and humbled to be able to accept my award from a leader who has led the nation through trying times such as the Asian financial crisis and SARS. 

My parents, who have taught me the value of giving back and treating others with kindness, have supported me immensely throughout my leadership journey. 

This award was also made possible due to the opportunities given to me by my teachers and the school to grow as a leader in the Student Council, in my CCA and in the classroom. I am grateful for my Council and CCA seniors, my EXCO team, fellow councillors and friends who have made me both a team player and a team leader. 

For the opportunities to serve and contribute in my school, I am thankful, and I will continue serving the community, carrying forward my actions in school to contribute back to the society.<br>
