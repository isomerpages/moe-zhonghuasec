### **International Science Youth Forum (ISYF) 2018**
Three Secondary 3 Talent Development Programme (TDP) students represented Zhonghua Secondary School in the 2018 International Science Youth Forum (ISYF) in Hwa Chong Institution from 21st to 25th January 2018. They had the rare opportunity to interact with the Nobel Laureates and eminent scientists through masterclasses and dialogue sessions. Besides visiting various industries and Universities, they also learned more about other cultures through the cultural exchange programme.

Here are their reflections:

Participating in the International Science Youth Forum (ISYF) was an insightful experience for me. I feel honoured to be able to attend this event and interact with the Nobel Laureates. Throughout the five days, I made friends with both foreign delegates and Singaporeans students. I learnt more about the different cultures and languages. I also learnt how to respect and be sensitive to the different cultures. The friendships made is something I cherish.  

Next, the interaction with the Nobel Laureates widened my horizon. I learnt about how Professor Ada Yonath discovered the effect antibodies have on the ribosome structure. I had difficulties trying to digest the amount of information shared as they were targeted at Junior College students. Another Nobel Laureate, Tim Hunt, also shared about his discovery of cyclin. I realised that research is very important in order to understand the information given.  

Lastly, I have become more responsible after my 5-day stay in the boarding school. Taking care of my own health and organising my things is part and parcel of being responsible. Overall, I learnt many things and benefited immensely from this experience.<br>

 Overall, the ISYF is enriching as I get to learn more about things that I do not get to learn in school, such as how antibiotics attack bacteria and how laser can capture atoms. I also met Nobel Laureates and learnt about their journey. They shared about their passion, curiosity and perseverance. These sharing gave me a lot of insights and will be useful for me in the future.  

I also had the opportunity to bond with people from other countries and learn about their culture and heritage. We formed such strong friendships that even after the ISYF is over, we still continue to keep in touch.  

Through the ISYF, I learned more about how universities work and found out about some universities that I never knew existed in Singapore! I toured some of the universities and saw the facilities they offer and the way they teach their students, such as using team-based learning. This will be helpful in the future when I consider which university to go to.<br>

I learnt more about science and about other cultures through the ISYF. The ISYF was very fun as we took part in different activities such as the amazing race and the icebreakers. Most of all, I enjoyed the company of the international and local delegates and the facilitators. Overall, it was a great experience and I enjoyed it very much. I am very grateful for the opportunity to be part of the ISYF team from Zhonghua Secondary School!<br>
