We are on the lookout for driven individuals who demonstrate positive character traits as well as our school values of Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence, to join our school through the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise held once each year.  

We welcome all current Primary Six students (or equivalent) to apply for admission to our school in the academic year of 2023 through the DSA-Sec exercise. We offer Singaporeans and foreign students who fulfil the minimum criteria for secondary school admission, have specific talents, and attained outstanding achievements in one or more of the following:

*   Sports
*   Performing Arts
*   Student Leadership
