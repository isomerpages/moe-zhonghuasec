The Eco Heroes Programme is a STEM programme for all Secondary 2 students.

In the Eco Heroes Programme, we aim to:
* educate students by sharing some of the issues pertaining to sustainability, such as sustainable waste management, recycling, water &amp; energy conservation and food wastage. 
* develop thinking skills by connecting knowledge across subject disciplines in the context of sustainability.
* develop analytical skills using data analytics tools to analyse authentic data and to address sustainability issues using design thinking protocol. 

#### Key Sustainability Issues
Students will acquaint themselves with the key issues of sustainability of our earth and her ecosystems through the following 5 themes that are pertinent to Singapore:


| Theme | Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) | Brief Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Theme 1: Waste Management     | Responsible Consumption &amp; Production     |  ●	In 2022, Singapore generated about 7.4 million tonnes of waste. The amount of waste generated is expected to increase with population and economic growth. <br><br>●	Semakau Landfill is projected to run out of space by 2035 and Singapore’s household recycling rate in 2022 fell to 12 per cent – the lowest in more than a decade.     |
| Theme 2: Food Security | Zero Hunger     |  ●	Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply and is vulnerable to global food supply shocks.<br><br>●	External environment is increasingly uncertain and volatile due to impacts of climate change. <br><br>●	Increase in food consumption due to Singapore’s growing population and middle class will add additional stress to our food supply. |
| Theme 3: Water Constraints | Clean Water &amp; Sanitation    | ●	Singapore’s water demand is set to double by 2060 – a year before water deal with Malaysia expires.<br><br>●	Conventional water sources (local catchments and imported water) are dependent on rainfall. Dry weather can threaten the reliability of our water supply. |
| Theme 4: Energy Sources | Affordable &amp; Clean Energy    | ●	Singapore has pledged a long-term low emissions development strategy (LEDS) with a clear goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and our updated 2030 NDC to reduce our emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.<br><br>●	In Singapore, we have limited renewable energy options, with most of our electricity generated using natural gas. Singapore does not have hydro resources, our wind speeds and mean tidal range are low, and geothermal energy is not economically viable. |
| Theme 5: Biodiversity Protection | Life on Land    | ●	Risk of compromising biodiversity protection due to continued development. <br><br>● Fragmentation of habitats, where natural areas are bisected by roads or other developments.<br><br>●	Edges of habitats are more susceptible to fragmentation due to air, noise and light pollution from developed areas. |
