### **Zhonghua Secondary School Future-Ready Framework**

![](/images/Picture1.png)

##### **Introduction**
1.       In envisioning the Zhonghua Secondary School Future-Ready framework for education, we begin with the core, our RICE (Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Excellence) Values, which serve as the foundation upon which all else is built. They are the guiding principles that shape our approach to education, ensuring that students are not only prepared for the challenges of tomorrow but also equipped with a strong moral compass.

##### **Competencies for the future**
2.       Moving outward, the framework emphasises a comprehensive set of competencies essential for students to thrive in the 21st Century. These encompass not only traditional academic skills but also the ability to navigate the digital landscape, communicate effectively in the new media age, and cultivate socio-emotional intelligence, fostering well-rounded individuals ready for a rapidly changing world.

##### **Four Pillars of Education Focus**
3.       At ZHSS, we take pride in our commitment to delivering a holistic education that prepares our students for the complex challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century. Our approach is underpinned by four pillars of education - STEAM Education, Sustainability Education, Character Education, and Glocal (Global-Local) Education. These pillars are integral to our mission to nurture Passionate Learners, Dynamic Leaders and Connected Citizens.

**a)   STEAM Education: Fostering Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking**
*   STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) Education is a dynamic platform for cultivating critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking in students.
*   Critical thinking is nurtured through problem-solving activities that require analytical skills and the ability to assess evidence from multiple angles. Meanwhile, the interdisciplinary nature of STEAM encourages adaptive thinking as students tackle real-world challenges that demand flexibility and the capacity to adjust their strategies in response to changing circumstances.
*   Inventive thinking flourishes through creative projects that prompt students to explore innovative solutions and embrace experimentation.
*   In this way, STEAM education fosters a holistic approach to learning, equipping students with the essential skills and mindset necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.

**b)   Sustainability Education: Nurturing Environmental Stewards for a Sustainable Future**
*   At ZHSS, we are committed to environmental sustainability. Our Eco Stewardship Programme equips students with the knowledge and skills to address pressing global issues such as climate change and resource conservation.
*   Through experiential learning, fieldwork and community engagement, students learn about conservation, renewable energy and ecological balance. We aim to cultivate a generation of environmental stewards who can make informed decisions and drive sustainable practices in their future careers and communities.

**c)   Character Education: Building Ethical Leaders with Resilience and Integrity**
*   Character Education is woven into the fabric of our school culture. We understand that academic excellence alone does not define success. Our comprehensive Character Education Programme focuses on the school RICE Values of Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence. Through a combination of classroom discussions, experiential learning and community service, students develop strong moral and ethical foundations. We are committed to nurturing individuals who exhibit leadership qualities grounded in ethical principles.

**d)   Global Education: Cultivating Cultural Awareness and Social Responsibility**
*   Glocal Education is an essential part of our curriculum. We recognise the importance of preparing students to be informed global citizens who can engage with diverse cultures and address local and global challenges.
*   Our students have opportunities for cultural exchange, international partnerships, and service-learning projects that expand their horizons and instill a sense of social responsibility. We encourage them to become active contributors to their local communities and responsible global citizens, capable of addressing complex global challenges.

##### **Signature Programmes**
4.       Our Signature Programmes complement these Educational Focus Areas, offering students a diverse range of opportunities for growth. The Digital Literacy Programme equips them with essential technological skills, while the Eco Stewardship Programme instills environmental consciousness. The Cross-Cultural Programme develops cultural empathy and understanding, and the Talent Development Programme recognises and nurtures the unique abilities and strengths of identified individuals. The Student Leadership Programme fosters the skills needed to lead self and others, and the Art Elective Programme encourages creative expression and innovation.

##### **Outcomes**
5.       All these elements come together under our overarching school vision in developing Scholars and Leaders who are

*   Passionate Learners who approach education with enthusiasm and curiosity;
*   Dynamic Leaders who are well-prepared to navigate and lead in an ever-evolving world; and
*   Connected Citizens who understand their role in a global society.

With this Future-Ready Framework, we are committed to preparing our students not only for success but also for a life ready to learn, to work and to live.
