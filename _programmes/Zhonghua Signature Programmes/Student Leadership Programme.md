#### Student Leadership Programme

Our Student Leadership Programme aims to nurture students to become dynamic servant leaders committed to leading themselves and others. Customised and run by our student leaders, we believe in the approach of “leaders growing leaders”, empowering our student leaders in the training and mentoring of their juniors.

##### The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership  
Our school adopts the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model in our Student Leadership Programme. Its principles are based on a set of observable skills and abilities that drive behaviours. Our student leaders are encouraged to practise these five exemplary leadership practices when discharging their duties.
