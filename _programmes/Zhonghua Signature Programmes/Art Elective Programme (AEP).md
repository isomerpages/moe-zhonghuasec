### **Art Elective Programme (AEP)**
Zhonghua Secondary School started the first batch of AEP in 2010. Now it is an established AEP school that offers an exciting and rigorous 4-year art programme for our Zhonghuarians. Through contextualised learning experiences, students learn to apply their art skills on real-world issues and situations. This is further underpinned by the theoretical knowledge of the development and roles of art in different contexts of culture and time.

Annually, camps, workshops and learning journeys are conducted for AEP students to expose them to the multitude of expressions in the modern and contemporary art. For example, the Sec 1 and Sec 3 AEP students participate in the combined AEP schools workshops to learn new art skills and art forms with their fellow AEP peers.

The Art Unit also arranges a biannual 4D3N Visual Art Trip to Penang for our Sec 3 AEP students. Students will have the opportunity to gain insight into different art forms, which helps to broaden their perspective to art.

Together with the students from other AEP schools, our students also have the opportunity to exhibit artworks at the Art Elective Programme Exhibition at external grounds. Our AEP students share their art pieces and artmaking processes in the various in-school exhibitions too. For example, the Sec 1 to Sec 3 AEP students showcase their artworks in the annual ‘Pre10’ AEP exhibition, and our annual ‘Expose 90’ Art exhibition features works by our Sec 4 graduates. As young advocates of the Art, our Sec 2 and Sec 3 AEP students conduct mini art workshops for fellow Zhonghuarians and primary school students.

Since 2012, Zhonghua AEP adopted and weaved the Lincoln Centre Education (LCE) approach into the various problem-based and inquiry-based pedagogies to develop students' capacities for imagination. The ten capacities (see below) provide students and teachers with another dimension to understand students’ artistic development over the years. With the support from the National Arts Council (NAC), the school’s practice and customisation of the LCE approach has been endorsed and affirmed by LCE when the LCE artist-instructors from New York in 2013 and 2015 visited the school.
