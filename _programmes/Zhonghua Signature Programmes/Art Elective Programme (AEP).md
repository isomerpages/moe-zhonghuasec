##### Practitioners, Scholars, Advocates and Leaders in Art and the Arts

Zhonghua Secondary School introduced its inaugural Art Elective Programme (AEP) in 2010, marking the beginning of a transformative journey to offer an engaging and challenging 4-year art curriculum for Zhonghuarians. The emphasis is on contextualised learning, enabling students to apply their artistic skills to real-world issues and situations. This practical approach is complemented by a solid foundation in the theoretical aspects of Art, exploring its development and roles across diverse cultural and temporal contexts.

Annually, the AEP at Zhonghua organises a spectrum of activities, such as camps, workshops, and learning journeys designed to expose students to the rich tapestry of expressions in modern and contemporary art. Notable among these activities are the combined AEP schools' workshops, where Sec 1 and Sec 3 AEP students collaborate with peers from other schools to explore new Art skills and forms. Collaboration is a key theme in Zhonghua's AEP, with students participating in joint exhibitions both within the school and on external platforms. AEP students, alongside their peers from other schools, showcase their artworks at the Art Elective Programme Exhibition, contributing to a vibrant and dynamic artistic community. Additionally, Zhonghua's exhibitions, such as the Aesthetics Week AEP Showcase and the Expos√© 90 Graduates' Art Exhibition serve as platforms for students to share their artistic endeavours.

Since 2012, Zhonghua Secondary School has embraced the Lincoln Centre Education (LCE) approach, seamlessly incorporating it into problem-based and inquiry-based pedagogies. This innovative approach fosters students' capacities for imagination and introduces a dynamic choice-based dimension to art learning. The LCE framework, encompassing ten capacities that span from noticing deeply to reflecting and assessing, provides a robust structure for comprehending artistic development.

As advocates and leaders of Art learning, both Lower Secondary AEP students and Upper Secondary AEP students actively engage in community-oriented art initiatives. The Lower Secondary AEP students contribute their artistic talents to community projects, while the Upper Secondary AEP students extend their expertise by conducting Art workshops. These workshops, designed not only for their peers but also for fellow Zhonghuarians and primary school students, exemplify Zhonghua Secondary School's dedication to fostering a vibrant community of creative and expressive individuals. This dual-tiered approach underscores the school's commitment to nurturing artistic endeavours at various levels within the community.
