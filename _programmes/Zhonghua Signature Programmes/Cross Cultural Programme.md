With technology shrinking the world where people now interact more often than before, developing cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity becomes crucial for everyone. There are different platforms that provide opportunities for students to learn about other cultures within and beyond our shores, cultivate cross-cultural skills and develop a global outlook.

**(a) Local Culture:** Programmes are planned to create awareness and understanding of our local cultures through celebrating major festivals during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, and Mid-autumn festival. This allows students to understand the practices and customs of the different ethnic groups. Through performances, sharing and experiential learning, greater awareness and understanding of the different cultures are deepened. Students also go on cultural learning journeys to Kampong Glam, Little India and Chinatown, to acquire a deeper understanding of the different cultures in Singapore.

**(b) Global Culture:** To develop a global perspective, the school also organises overseas trips for selected Sec 2 students. Students will experience cultural exchanges with counterparts from overseas schools in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc. where they learn more about the local culture. In return, they will also introduce different cultures in Singapore to visiting students, and bring them to local cultural neighbourhoods such as Kampong Glam and Chinatown.
