### **Environmental Sustainability Programme**
<img src="/images/esp1.jpg" style="width:25%">

The Environmental Sustainability Programme aims to heighten Zhonghuarians’ awareness of issues that can affect the environment that everyone depends on.  With the use of current context, students learn through various measures taken by our local community to address the environmental issues and provides a platform for the students to act as problem solvers to take actions to improve the environment that they live in.  
  
The logo consists of two parts, the green begonia outline representing Zhonghuarians while the red core representing the love towards the environment.

* Through environment education, we hope to
*  develop **thinking skills** and **connect knowledge** across subject disciplines in environmental and sustainability issues  
*  **empower** students by educating them on issues pertaining to conservation and sustainability in environment  
*  provide opportunities for students to be **active participants in environmental issues** and examine issue at national and local levels.

Students will gain values such as (i) **tolerance and understanding** while investigating varying sides of issues to understand the full picture, (ii) **sensitivity, appreciation, and respect** for the environment, and (iii) **responsibility** towards the environment where students understand how their decisions and actions affect the environment.

The ESE committee plans and carries out broad-based and niche environmental activities to raise awareness on environmental issues.
