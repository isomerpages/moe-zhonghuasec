STEAM represents STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) plus the arts – Humanities, Language Arts, Music, Visual Arts, Design Thinking, New Media, Creativity and Communication Skills. Technological innovation remains tightly coupled with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math – the STEM subjects. Art, design and creativity are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century just as science and technology did in the last century. We need to add A to the equation — to transform STEM into STEAM.

The STEAM Research Programme is a one-year research project for the Talent Development Programme (TDP) students. The students are mentored by Zhonghua teachers on projects related to the theme of sustainability and livability and they adopt both the creative problem solving and design thinking frameworks, which provide useful scaffolds for young innovators as they seek creative solution to real life problems. They will also have the opportunity to take part in the Innovation Programme (IvP) organised by MOE Gifted Education Branch.

The objectives for the STEAM Research Programme are to: <br>
1\. Provide an opportunity for our students to work on real world problems that encourages the application of STEAM.<br>
2\. Support our students’ talents, interests in global issues, natural curiosity and creativity.<br>
3\. Help our students understand how each discipline is connected and related in the real world.<br>
4\. Equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to be the next generation of entrepreneurs, creative thinkers and inventors.
