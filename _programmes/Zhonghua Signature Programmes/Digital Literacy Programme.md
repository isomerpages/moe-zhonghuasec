#### Equipping Students with Digital Literacy Skills

As the educational landscape, the working world and our personal lives become more intertwined with digital platforms, Zhonghua Secondary School finds it essential to equip our Secondary 1 students with the necessary digital literacy skills for them to be confident and responsible digital learners.

#### Building Confidence in Using the Personalised Learning Device (PLD)

The school identified problems that teachers and students commonly faced in class when using their PLDs. Students encountered issues like difficulty in logging in, network problems and challenges with file navigation. Students within a class also demonstrated varied levels of familiarity when it came to the use of software applications like Microsoft in the classroom. Many of these issues disrupted teachers’ efforts to conduct seamless lessons.

Hence, the school identified a common set of baseline skills that are required for students to use their PLDs effectively for learning. The school tapped on our ICT Department teachers to help our students acquire these essential knowledge and baseline skills. This empowered students to become tech-savvy learners, as they can independently troubleshoot common problems when using their PLDs.

#### Baseline Skills
* Typing Skills
* Digital Literacy Skills
* Basic Troubleshooting Skills

#### Providing Platforms to Apply and Demonstrate the Skills Learnt from the Programme

Students apply their learning by completing mini projects in small groups after each lesson to consolidate their learning from the programme. For example, students use Google Slides to present their work on a given topic. They then provide feedback to their peers by commenting on other groups' presentation slides.

The school promoted student agency by including tasks for students to create self-help videos to help the next batch of students learn. The videos are shared on the school’s social media platforms and NDLP micro-site for students to explore in their free time. These “how-to” videos cover usage of the stylus, Google Calendar, and OneNote.

Application of the digital skills learnt are then infused into the curriculum of various subjects, providing students with opportunities to collaborate with one another to create digital artefacts such as presentations and infographics.
