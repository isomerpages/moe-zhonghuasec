### **Robotics and Computing Programme**
To ride of the current global wave for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education, the school has positioned Robotics and Computing to strengthen the curriculum offering for applied learning.

#### **Robotics Strand**
##### **_Robotics Module_**
The Robotics Module is offered to all lower secondary Normal Stream students. Students will complete the module in two semesters over two years, and the content is integrated with Mathematics (Sec 1) and Science (Sec 2).

##### **_Robotics & Computing Festival_**
Annually, the school organises the Sec 1 Robotics and Computing Festival, where all Sec 1 students learn about the latest in STEM from experts in the fields. Sec 1 students who are interested in Robotics also take part in the Inter-class Robotics Competition to compete against one another in mini-challenges such as the Sumo-bot Challenge.

#### **Computing Strand**
##### **_Code for Fun_**
Zhonghua seeks to equip students with relevant ICT skills and develop students’ coding and computational thinking skills through the Code for Fun programme for Lower Sec 1E, 1N, 2E and 2N students. Students learn about animation and games programming in this 2-year programme.

##### **_Computing as a GCE ‘O’ Level Subject_**
Express students who show interest and potential in Coding can choose to take up Computing as an O-Level subject. The subject aims to provide students with the foundation to continue with further studies in computing and skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment so that the concepts and skills learnt would also be applicable in other fields that require computing.
